strategists now say that this battle for the white house could feature more substantive debate over global warming policy than any previous presidential race on monday   mr  obama is expected to unveil his signature climate change policy   a set of environmental protection agency regulations designed to sharply reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the nation  s power plants

if the plan survives legal challenges   it could lead to the closing of hundreds of polluting coal fired power plants   freeze future construction of such plants and lead to an explosion in production of wind and solar energy most of those changes   however   would unfold under the next president : states would not submit final plans detailing how they would comply with the rules until 2018

that means that the 2016 field faces a much more specific question on climate change policy than any of their predecessors have : what would they do to mr  obama  s climate change legacy

  there  s no question that the decision of a sitting president on something like this insinuates these issues into the middle of a campaign     said david axelrod   the political strategist who advised both of mr  obama  s presidential campaigns  
`/`` There/EX 's/VBZ no/DT question/NN that/IN the/DT decision/NN of/IN a/DT sitting/VBG president/NN on/IN something/NN like/IN this/DT insinuates/VBZ these/DT issues/NNS into/IN the/DT middle/NN of/IN a/DT campaign/NN ,/, '/'' said/VBD David/NNP Axelrod/NNP ,/, the/DT political/JJ strategist/NN who/WP advised/VBD both/DT of/IN Mr./NNP Obama/NNP 's/POS presidential/JJ campaigns/NNS ./.

  the answer to that question is already a litmus test for the deep pocketed political donors who will play a major role in the 2016 outcome on the left   the billionaire environmentalist tom steyer   the largest single donor in the 2014 midterm elections   has made clear that forceful support of climate policies   including implementation of mr  obama  s plan   is essential to win his financial backing

they were less likely to vote for candidates who questioned or denied the science that determined that humans caused global warming among republicans   48 percent say they are more likely to vote for a candidate who supports fighting climate change   a result that jon a  krosnick   a professor of political science at stanford university and an author of the survey   called   the most powerful finding   in the poll

many republican candidates question the science of climate change or do not publicly address the issue nonetheless   47 percent of republicans still said they believed that policies designed to curb global warming would hurt the economy although the poll found that climate change was not a top issue in determining a person  s vote   a candidate  s position on climate change influences how a person will vote

for example   67 percent of respondents   including 48 percent of republicans and 72 percent of independents   said they were less likely to vote for a candidate who said that human caused climate change is a hoax the results came as climate change was emerging as a source of debate in the coming presidential campaign in 2012   all the republican presidential candidates but one   jon m  huntsman jr    questioned or denied the science that determined that humans caused global warming   and opposed policies to curb greenhouse gas emissions

  but those positions appear to be out of step with the majority of the electorate the poll found that 83 percent of americans   including 61 percent of republicans and 86 percent of independents   say that if nothing is done to reduce emissions   global warming will be a very or somewhat serious problem in the future but substantial differences remain between the two parties on the issue democrats are much more likely than republicans or independents to say that the issue of global warming is important to them

to win the presidency   republicans clearly need to improve their numbers among women   but their approach on reproductive issues appears likely to make that goal difficult further compounding the hurdles facing republicans are the party  s current drive to defund planned parenthood   and the sustained effort to reduce the number of abortion clinics in republican controlled states this effort includes legislation effectively closing such clinics by requiring   in the case of texas   that   a physician performing or inducing an abortion must   on the date the abortion is performed   have active admitting privileges at a hospital that is located not further than 30 miles from the location at which the abortion is performed     and that abortion facilities must meet the   minimum standards for ambulatory surgical centers     requiring women to undergo sometimes invasive ultrasound procedures before being allowed to have an abortion   and imposing restrictions on abortion coverage in private health insurance plans the conflicts over reproductive rights within both the republican party and within the social conservative movement are inevitable

in the command centers of republican presidential campaigns   aides have drawn comfort from the belief that donald j  trump  s dominance in the polls is a political summer fling   like herman cain in 2011   an unsustainable boomlet dependent on megawatt celebrity   narrow appeal and unreliable surveys of americans with a spotty record of actually voting in primaries a growing body of evidence suggests that may be wishful thinking a review of public polling   extensive interviews with a host of his supporters in two states and a new private survey that tracks voting records all point to the conclusion that mr  trump has built a broad   demographically and ideologically diverse coalition   constructed around personality   not substance   that bridges demographic and political divides

those factors may have created conditions for his candidacy to thrive   but his personality   celebrity and boldness   not merely his populism and policy stances   have let him take advantage of them tellingly   when asked to explain support for mr  trump in their own words   voters of varying backgrounds used much the same language   calling him   ballsy   and saying they admired that he   tells it like it is   and relished how he   is n t politically correct

in interviews   campaign pollsters argue that such polls   conducted largely by media organizations and universities   rely on feedback from many republicans who are unlikely to vote because the polls do not verify the party registration or voting history of respondents   a fact that those conducting the surveys concede new data provided to the times by civis analytics   a firm aligned with democrats and founded by the former chief analytics officer of the obama re election campaign   shows that there is merit to those concerns   but not enough to call mr  trump  s lead into question

right now   for instance   america is facing serious new security threats   including islamic state forces marauding across iraq and syria   and there is every reason for the country to rethink the appropriate level of defense spending yet those who argue for funneling billions more to the pentagon stand on very shaky ground when billions of dollars have been squandered on troubled weapons like the f 35 fighter jet   when billions more have been lost to waste and corruption in afghanistan   and when the budget proposals from both mr  obama and congress waste billions more on an overgrown nuclear arsenal meanwhile   congress has consistently refused to finance the state department at the level needed to show a commitment to robust diplomacy through its staff   embassies and programs promoting democracy   trade   and the resolution of numerous conflicts around the world if lawmakers want to raise defense spending   they should address those issues first and then honestly own up to the fact that any major increase would require a significant and transparent rewriting of past agreements

in particular   polls show that majorities of hispanics   young people and unmarried women   the voters who were central to mr  obama  s victories in 2008 and 2012   support candidates who back climate change policy but republicans are betting that despite the polls   they can make the case that regulations to cut greenhouse pollution will result in the loss of jobs and hurt the economy

the architect of mr  obama  s climate change plan is none other than his senior counselor   john d  podesta   who is likely to leave the white house next year to work as the chairman of mrs  clinton  s campaign the climate plan that mr  podesta has drafted for mr  obama is expected to serve as a blueprint for mrs  clinton  s climate change policy   should she run since the deal mr  obama made with china calls for the united states to cut its planet warming carbon pollution by as much as 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025   he has effectively placed the obligation on his successor to meet that goal that dynamic sets up climate change as a potentially explosive issue on the 2016 campaign trail   which may pit mrs  clinton against a field of republican candidates who question and deny the science that human activity causes global warming

  as evidence   republican strategists point to their recent wave of victories in this year  s midterm elections   when they campaigned aggressively against mr  obama  s e p a  regulations but democrats are increasingly emboldened by polls showing that in national elections   candidates who push climate change policies will win support from voters according to a 2013 poll by stanford university   73 percent of americans believe that the earth has been warming over the past 100 years   while 81 percent of americans think global warming poses a serious problem in the united states

winston salem   n c    a federal trial that may help shape voting rights protections across the country in the 2016 elections and beyond came to a close here friday   with the department of justice and civil rights groups charging that north carolina deliberately sought to suppress black voting with a new election law   while the state defended its right to set election rules and said it treated all races equally

  african americans were on the verge of having real influence in the state of north carolina     bert russ   a lawyer with the justice department   said of the expanded voting procedures that were curtailed in a republican sponsored 2013 law

the justice department asked the judge   thomas d  schroeder of federal district court   who is hearing the case with no jury   not only to block the 2013 law   but also to reinstate strong federal oversight of election practices in north carolina that oversight came to an end in 2013   when the supreme court effectively struck down a crucial provision of the voting rights act of 1965   which required federal approval of election changes in states with histories of discrimination   including north carolina

  this is a key test case under the voting rights act and the constitution     said richard l  hasen   a voting rights expert at the university of california   irvine   school of law

  if north carolina is able to roll back rules to ease registration and voting   for reasons which seem little more than an attempt to secure partisan advantage   then expect other states with republican governments to follow

  in the case here   and two in texas involving redistricting and a voter id law   civil rights advocates hope the courts will give strong legal teeth to a surviving section of the voting rights act

confusion among european leaders about how to deal with the crisis raises questions about the political unity that is essential to the survival of the eurozone these factors could undermine the positive effects of the bond buying stimulus program   known as quantitative easing   that the european central bank began in march as a way to pump money into the eurozone economy and force down market interest rates as a result   some analysts   so far apparently a minority   expect mr  draghi to send a strong signal on thursday that the central bank  s governing council is ready to step up its bond purchases and continue them longer than currently planned but any talk of more stimulus would reawaken tensions on the governing council between those who think the central bank has already done too much and those who favor aggressive   pre emptive action

the sum is roughly in line with its aim of monthly government bond purchases of   50 billion there is scope to increase the pace of the purchases   analysts said   and some see a chance that on thursday mr  draghi will signal an increased willingness to do so he could also signal that the european central bank intends to continue the stimulus spending beyond september 2016   the earliest it has said it would end the program
