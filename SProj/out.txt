a fast talking and born again veteran of conservative politics with experience in washington texas and california mr lane 60 travels the country trying to persuade evangelical clergy members to become politically active his hope is that the politicized pastors will help mobilize congregations that have been disheartened by the repeated failure of socially conservative candidates and by a party that has softened its opposition to same sex marriage it is an organizing approach far different from those in the days when larger than life leaders like the moral majority founder jerry falwell who died in 2007 or pat robertson now 84 could activate evangelical voters simply by anointing a candidate but close observers of evangelicals and their political involvement say mr lane is emblematic of a new generation of evangelical leaders who draw local support or exert influence through niche issues or their own networks unlike political operatives such as ralph reed the former executive director of the christian coalition who helped elect george w bush before becoming ensnared in the jack abramoff lobbying scandal mr lane does not have an extensive organization what mr lane a former public relations man does have going for him is a decentralized landscape in which a determined believer with an extensive network of ground level evangelical leaders and a limitless capacity for talking on the phone can exert influence on republican presidential candidates eager to reach evangelical voters

similarly mr kerry s friends say they believe he would hear out party leaders if mr sanders appeared likely to capture the nomination and they implored mr kerry who would have to resign as secretary of state to try to block him the interest in senior statesmen and stateswomen is partly a reflection of the thin democratic bench after widespread losses in races for governor senate and other offices in 2010 and 2014 which has left the party with relatively few experienced credible presidential contenders let alone ones willing to take on mrs clinton

 the document is undergirded by two major presidential initiatives that have virtually no chance in congress : large tax increases on multinational corporations and the rich and a comprehensive immigration law that would lift the economy with millions of newly legalized taxpaying workers the proceeds of those initiatives would pay for free community college more generous child care subsidies and education tax credits paid sick leave expanded unemployment benefits and tax credits for two earner middle class couples among other offerings the white house even did away with the usual plain blue budget document cover for a gritty black and white photo of the tappan zee bridge in new york making vivid the president s emphasis on a 21st century infrastructure that creates jobs for thousands of construction workers and engineers connects hard working americans to their jobs and makes it easier for businesses to transport goods as mr obama wrote in the opening budget message the push reflects the degree to which mr obama emerged from last year s midterm election losses determined to reinforce rather than scale back his belief that the government should play a fundamental role in spreading economic prosperity

washington the obama administration s top intelligence counterterrorism and law enforcement officials are divided over which terrorist group poses the biggest threat to the american homeland the islamic state or al qaeda and its affiliates the split reflects a rising concern that the islamic state poses a more immediate danger because of its unprecedented social media campaign using sophisticated online messaging to inspire followers to launch attacks across the united states many intelligence and counterterrorism officials warn however that qaeda operatives in yemen and syria are capitalizing on the turmoil in those countries to plot much larger mass casualty attacks including bringing down airliners carrying hundreds of passengers this is not an academic argument

washington when joseph r biden jr became the chairman of the senate judiciary committee in 1987 a few months ahead of his first and ultimately unsuccessful presidential campaign he told aides his goal was to enact legislation that would take a comprehensive approach to reducing crime as the ranking minority member of the committee since 1981 mr biden had helped pass two bills establishing mandatory minimums for drug offenses

but as chairman facing high violent crime rates a crack cocaine epidemic and accusations by republicans that his party was soft on crime mr biden wanted holistic reform the effort which defined much of his time as committee chairman culminated in the 1994 violent crime control and law enforcement act a sweeping bipartisan bill that touched nearly every aspect of american law enforcement that was signed into law by president bill clinton more than two decades later that legislation is once again the subject of fierce debate this time as a bipartisan coalition of activists and lawmakers seeks to undo the era of mass incarceration they say the 1994 crime bill helped create the rapid shift in mood that those efforts reflect a reaction to falling crime rates and a renewed attention to issues of racial injustice could prove one of many hurdles for mr biden if he decides to become a candidate for president already in the 2016 presidential race criminal justice has commanded a level of attention unseen since the 1990s and has compelled both republicans and democrats to have something new to say about it

the battle for the republican presidential nomination has produced an unexpectedly intense burst of attacks on women s reproductive rights not only on the right to abortion but also by implication on some of the most commonly used methods of contraception the shift to an aggressively conservative posture stands in direct contrast to the party s previous five presidential nominees all of whom sought during their campaigns to play down social issues in the current republican presidential contest 16 candidates have staked out positions against abortion the exception is george pataki former governor of new york who is pro choice

to win the presidency republicans clearly need to improve their numbers among women but their approach on reproductive issues appears likely to make that goal difficult further compounding the hurdles facing republicans are the party s current drive to defund planned parenthood and the sustained effort to reduce the number of abortion clinics in republican controlled states this effort includes legislation effectively closing such clinics by requiring in the case of texas that a physician performing or inducing an abortion must on the date the abortion is performed have active admitting privileges at a hospital that is located not further than 30 miles from the location at which the abortion is performed and that abortion facilities must meet the minimum standards for ambulatory surgical centers requiring women to undergo sometimes invasive ultrasound procedures before being allowed to have an abortion and imposing restrictions on abortion coverage in private health insurance plans the conflicts over reproductive rights within both the republican party and within the social conservative movement are inevitable

when ready for hillary a pro hillary rodham clinton super pac wanted to take out a million dollar loan five months before it planned to go out of business it turned to a bank that was founded to guard the savings of new york city garment workers when the democracy alliance an influential club of liberal donors sought to recruit members in advance of the 2016 elections the bank s president helped to make introductions and when workers rights groups wanted to embarrass walmart and the gap for unsafe working conditions at factories supplying their stores amalgamated bank which manages 40 billion in pension fund assets stepped in again rounding up fellow investors to warn the companies that they could face lawsuits and shareholder actions four years after nearly collapsing amid the financial crisis amalgamated has aggressively carved out a position as the left s private banker leveraging deep connections with the democratic establishment to expand rapidly in a niche long dominated by larger but less nimble financial institutions the bank s rise has been driven not only by the pace and complexity of modern campaigns which demand increasingly specialized financial services but by their vastly expanded scale : billion dollar presidential campaigns are expected for both parties in 2016 bolstered by super pacs raising hundreds of millions of dollars more and with republican outside groups raising substantially more than their left leaning counterparts this year democratic strategists viewed amalgamated as a tool to leverage the financial clout of labor unions and left leaning philanthropists founded and still principally owned by labor unions the 92 year old bank has signed up hundreds of new political clients including most of the democratic party s major committees the progressive organizations that align with them and several of their top senate recruits this spring amalgamated scored its biggest coup yet winning the main business for mrs clinton s presidential campaign which is likely to raise a billion dollars or more campaign clients have access to a 24 hour concierge service staffed by veterans of president obama s campaigns to handle last minute media buys or reconcile election paperwork because it knows their donor world amalgamated is willing to advance cash on new contributions almost immediately

 a democrat familiar with biden s deliberations said recent discussions have focused on whether biden s family would be ready to pursue a third presidential campaign only months after the death of the vice president s son beau biden also under consideration is whether biden can meet the basic criteria to be a serious contender such as whether he would have a plausible path to victory in the campaign and whether he would be able to raise enough money to be competitive the democrat spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the private conversations biden s trip to florida one of the nation s premiere campaign battleground states includes meetings with jewish leaders on thursday who are skeptical of obama s effort to win support for the nuclear deal with iran he then heads to pittsburgh to march in a labor day parade on monday with afl cio president richard trumka who met privately with the vice president last week and says the field is still wide open if biden decides to run the travels mark the latest chapter in biden s deliberations which have included private discussions with family members and longtime aides at his delaware home and a naval observatory meeting with massachusetts sen elizabeth warren a popular liberal whose endorsement would be coveted by any democratic candidate warren said wednesday that she and biden had a good long rambly policy conversation at the naval observatory

in the command centers of republican presidential campaigns aides have drawn comfort from the belief that donald j trump s dominance in the polls is a political summer fling like herman cain in 2011 an unsustainable boomlet dependent on megawatt celebrity narrow appeal and unreliable surveys of americans with a spotty record of actually voting in primaries a growing body of evidence suggests that may be wishful thinking a review of public polling extensive interviews with a host of his supporters in two states and a new private survey that tracks voting records all point to the conclusion that mr trump has built a broad demographically and ideologically diverse coalition constructed around personality not substance that bridges demographic and political divides

the question is whether to do it honestly or not : whether to engage in a straightforward exercise that would require honestly confronting the 2011 budget agreement or whether to pump more money into the pentagon s overseas contingency operations account or o c o this would represent a further corruption of an account created to underwrite the wars in afghanistan and iraq but has since been used for purposes unrelated to these conflicts like the bombing in syria

what makes the account particularly useful to cynical legislators is that it is an off budget fund that allows them to increase defense spending and break the caps they agreed to while insisting that they remain as fiscally upright as ever disregarding the distinction between the normal defense budget and war spending in this way would set the stage for o c o to become a permanent slush fund for defense and set a dangerous precedent according to the nonpartisan committee for a responsible federal budget

right now for instance america is facing serious new security threats including islamic state forces marauding across iraq and syria and there is every reason for the country to rethink the appropriate level of defense spending yet those who argue for funneling billions more to the pentagon stand on very shaky ground when billions of dollars have been squandered on troubled weapons like the f 35 fighter jet when billions more have been lost to waste and corruption in afghanistan and when the budget proposals from both mr obama and congress waste billions more on an overgrown nuclear arsenal meanwhile congress has consistently refused to finance the state department at the level needed to show a commitment to robust diplomacy through its staff embassies and programs promoting democracy trade and the resolution of numerous conflicts around the world if lawmakers want to raise defense spending they should address those issues first and then honestly own up to the fact that any major increase would require a significant and transparent rewriting of past agreements

together these trends resulted in a 10 percent swing in voting power mr lichtman testified but mr farr a private lawyer hired by the state for this case said there was no proof that the curtailed election practices were responsible for the rise in black registration which he said may have been partly driven by excitement over the candidacy of barack obama it was no coincidence the plaintiffs argued that the legislature adopted the sweeping law only weeks after the supreme court decision shelby county v holder which ended federal oversight freed of that oversight the legislature giving vague reasons of efficiency and protecting electoral integrity immediately rolled out what experts said was the broadest range of cutbacks seen in any state in recent years

the bush administration created the program to try to find hidden terrorist cells on domestic soil after the attacks of sept 11 2001 and government officials have justified it by using al qaeda as an example the disclosure of the new details comes at a time of debates over a proposed agreement to drop sanctions against iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program and about n s a surveillance and the role of american communications companies in june congress enacted a law that will ban the systematic collection of domestic phone records after november and create a replacement program for analyzing links between callers in search of associates of terrorism suspects without the government s keeping the bulk data the document disclosing new information about the program is an august 2010 letter from the justice department to judge john bates then the presiding judge of the intelligence court

it began issuing orders to phone companies to turn over their customers calling records its orders were based on a secret interpretation of a provision of the u s a patriot act known as section 215 which permits the f b i to obtain business records deemed relevant to a national security investigation the theory accepted by the intelligence court but rejected in a recent appeals court ruling is that everyone s records are relevant to investigations hunting for terrorists because analyzing indirect links between callers can in theory reveal hidden relationships and sleeper cells after praising the program as crucial to preventing terrorist attacks intelligence agency officials now say that it has never thwarted one

the crisis in greece has faded for now at least but on thursday when mr draghi presides at a regularly scheduled meeting of the central bank s governing council he will need to address the welter of new and in some cases unexpected threats from around the globe which could create pressure for yet more stimulus spending a slowdown in the economy of china and other emerging markets has prompted wild swings in stock prices although markets were relatively calm on wednesday the federal reserve is poised to raise interest rates in the united states as early as this month possibly causing borrowing costs to rise in the eurozone before growth is strong enough some economists are even warning again about the eurozone s lapsing into deflation a broad decline in prices that is considered poisonous to growth and employment an influx of refugees into europe from syria and other conflict zones while outside the purview of monetary policy adds to the uncertainty

confusion among european leaders about how to deal with the crisis raises questions about the political unity that is essential to the survival of the eurozone these factors could undermine the positive effects of the bond buying stimulus program known as quantitative easing that the european central bank began in march as a way to pump money into the eurozone economy and force down market interest rates as a result some analysts so far apparently a minority expect mr draghi to send a strong signal on thursday that the central bank s governing council is ready to step up its bond purchases and continue them longer than currently planned but any talk of more stimulus would reawaken tensions on the governing council between those who think the central bank has already done too much and those who favor aggressive pre emptive action

for the near term the deal s merit will be judged on whether iran implements the rollback of its nuclear enrichment capabilities to which it has agreed and whether the deeply intrusive international inspection system it has accepted can detect and thereby deter any cheating here are some highlights from the interview : asked about whether we failed to use all of our leverage including a credible threat of force the president said : i think that criticism is misguided
