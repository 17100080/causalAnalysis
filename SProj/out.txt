`` what 's clear is that today 's voters endorse reagan 's legacy , however they see it.in a 2014 quinnipiac university poll , 35 percent of voters nationally chose reagan as the best president the united states has had since world war ii - well ahead of bill clinton 18 percent and john kennedy 15 percent.among republicans , reagan was the runaway favorite , with 66 percent picking him as the top president in recent history.that 's perhaps why opponents of the gop white house hopefuls are also sometimes eager to stand the candidates up next to reagan.in an online ad posted wednesday , the super pac backing democratic front-runner hillary rodham clinton 's campaign spliced some of the gop contenders ' comments into reagan 's famous `` morning in america '' tv ad from his 1984 campaign.after the narrator from the original ad says , `` it 's morning again in america , '' the ad cuts to trump at a podium saying , `` sadly , the american dream is dead .

a fast-talking and born-again veteran of conservative politics with experience in washington , texas and california , mr. lane , 60 , travels the country trying to persuade evangelical clergy members to become politically active.his hope is that the politicized pastors will help mobilize congregations that have been disheartened by the repeated failure of socially conservative candidates , and by a party that has softened its opposition to same-sex marriage.it is an organizing approach far different from those in the days when larger-than-life leaders like the moral majority founder , jerry falwell , who died in 2007 , or pat robertson , now 84 , could activate evangelical voters simply by anointing a candidate.but close observers of evangelicals and their political involvement say mr. lane is emblematic of a new generation of evangelical leaders who draw local support or exert influence through niche issues or their own networks.unlike political operatives such as ralph reed , the former executive director of the christian coalition who helped elect george w. bush before becoming ensnared in the jack abramoff lobbying scandal , mr. lane does not have an extensive organization.what mr. lane , a former public relations man , does have going for him is a decentralized landscape in which a determined believer with an extensive network of ground-level evangelical leaders and a limitless capacity for talking on the phone can exert influence on republican presidential candidates eager to reach evangelical voters .

washington - while the nation has been preoccupied with cacophonous presidential primary battles , the fight over control of the senate has been quietly falling into place.republican incumbents , who have the daunting task of defending 22 senate seats in 2016 , with about half in competitive states , appear to have snuffed out the ideological wars that have bedeviled them in the last four election cycles ; there is little evidence that tea party-endorsed challengers are targeting sitting senators.for now , the party 's fight for ideological purity has shifted to the race for the white house , and to within the halls of congress .

a dearth of tough primaries will most likely leave incumbents ' checkbooks and stamina intact for the general election.a primary drama of sorts has emerged in the democratic party , however , where battle lines are drawn less between dogmas than between establishment-chosen candidates and those trying to bust through the beltway gatekeepers.in illinois , for instance , representative tammy duckworth , a democrat favored to take on the deeply vulnerable republican senator , mark s. kirk , is feeling pressure from supporters of andrea zopp , a former president of the chicago urban league .

late june victories in the supreme court on health care and gay marriage , along with a win for his trade agenda on capitol hill , were followed by the landmark iran nuclear deal in july and the raising of the u.s. flag over a new embassy in cuba in august.instead of being overshadowed by the 2016 presidential campaign , obama 's agenda has often been driving the debate among the candidates running to replace him.and yet to the president , one of his summer 's biggest successes may simply be making it through his annual vacation on the tony massachusetts island of martha 's vineyard largely uninterrupted .

if hillary rodham clinton 's new apology for her private email server fails to reassure jittery supporters , it could amplify the chatter among some democrats who have been casting about for a potential white knight to rescue the party from a beleaguered clinton candidacy.vice president joseph r. biden jr. , secretary of state john kerry , senator elizabeth warren , former vice president al gore : each has been discussed among party officials in recent weeks as an alternative to mrs. clinton if she does not regain her once-dominant standing in the 2016 presidential field and instead remains mired in the long-running email controversy , with its attendant investigations.on monday , mr. biden , who has spoken publicly of pondering a run , looked very much like a candidate at a pittsburgh union gathering and labor day parade .

similarly , mr. kerry 's friends say they believe he would hear out party leaders if mr. sanders appeared likely to capture the nomination and they implored mr. kerry , who would have to resign as secretary of state , to try to block him.the interest in senior statesmen and stateswomen is partly a reflection of the thin democratic bench after widespread losses in races for governor , senate and other offices in 2010 and 2014 , which has left the party with relatively few experienced , credible presidential contenders , let alone ones willing to take on mrs. clinton .

the paucity of fresh faces even gave rise to a joking twitter hashtag : #dukakis 2016 , offering up the party 's 1988 nominee , former massachusetts gov. michael s. dukakis.still , mr. biden , mr. kerry and mr. gore have lost presidential bids before and are hardly guaranteed party saviors - or more popular than mrs. clinton among important demographic groups like women , african-americans and hispanics.indeed , for all of the talk about 2016 fallback plans , mrs. clinton remains the front-runner for the nomination , and her comments on tuesday in an interview with abc news and in a follow-up message to supporters - saying ` i 'm sorry ' for relying on private email for government business as secretary of state and calling that practice ' a mistake ' - may help assuage concerns among some democrats about her candidacy.but the chatter could continue if mrs. clinton does not quickly regain her footing .

` the document is undergirded by two major presidential initiatives that have virtually no chance in congress : large tax increases on multinational corporations and the rich , and a comprehensive immigration law that would lift the economy with millions of newly legalized , taxpaying workers.the proceeds of those initiatives would pay for free community college , more generous child care subsidies and education tax credits , paid sick leave , expanded unemployment benefits , and tax credits for two-earner middle-class couples , among other offerings.the white house even did away with the usual plain blue budget document cover for a gritty black-and-white photo of the tappan zee bridge in new york , making vivid the president 's emphasis on ' a 21st-century infrastructure that creates jobs for thousands of construction workers and engineers , connects hard-working americans to their jobs , and makes it easier for businesses to transport goods , ' as mr. obama wrote in the opening budget message.the push reflects the degree to which mr. obama emerged from last year 's midterm election losses determined to reinforce - rather than scale back - his belief that the government should play a fundamental role in spreading economic prosperity .

washington - when joseph r. biden jr. became the chairman of the senate judiciary committee in 1987 , a few months ahead of his first and ultimately unsuccessful presidential campaign , he told aides his goal was to enact legislation that would take a comprehensive approach to reducing crime.as the ranking minority member of the committee since 1981 , mr. biden had helped pass two bills establishing mandatory minimums for drug offenses .

but as chairman , facing high violent crime rates , a crack cocaine epidemic , and accusations by republicans that his party was soft on crime , mr. biden wanted holistic reform.the effort , which defined much of his time as committee chairman , culminated in the 1994 violent crime control and law enforcement act , a sweeping , bipartisan bill that touched nearly every aspect of american law enforcement that was signed into law by president bill clinton.more than two decades later , that legislation is once again the subject of fierce debate - this time , as a bipartisan coalition of activists and lawmakers seeks to undo the era of mass incarceration they say the 1994 crime bill helped create.the rapid shift in mood that those efforts reflect - a reaction to falling crime rates and a renewed attention to issues of racial injustice - could prove one of many hurdles for mr. biden if he decides to become a candidate for president.already , in the 2016 presidential race , criminal justice has commanded a level of attention unseen since the 1990s and has compelled both republicans and democrats to have something new to say about it .

` those are very different terms from those that filled the national conversation during mr. biden 's tenure as judiciary committee chairman from 1987 to 1995 , a period when democrats fought hard to revise a caricature of the party as soft on crime.the 1994 crime bill provided tens of billions of dollars to put thousands of additional police on the streets , build new prisons , increase border protection , and fund crime prevention programs .

for example , just read one recent paper published in the journal of the american medical association.the two physicians in the debate , ben carson and senator rand paul of kentucky , argued that while science connecting vaccines and autism is lacking , spreading out the childhood vaccination schedule might be advisable.but that 's a position strongly opposed by the medical community - because there is no link between autism and vaccination , spacing vaccines will not reduce the risk of a child developing autism.but because many parents ask for such delayed schedules , doctors often accommodate such demands , putting children at risk of catching diseases before they are vaccinated or potentially failing to complete their recommended vaccines.failing to vaccinate children has clear health risks .

they were less likely to vote for candidates who questioned or denied the science that determined that humans caused global warming.among republicans , 48 percent say they are more likely to vote for a candidate who supports fighting climate change , a result that jon a. krosnick , a professor of political science at stanford university and an author of the survey , called ` the most powerful finding ' in the poll .

many republican candidates question the science of climate change or do not publicly address the issue.nonetheless , 47 percent of republicans still said they believed that policies designed to curb global warming would hurt the economy.although the poll found that climate change was not a top issue in determining a person 's vote , a candidate 's position on climate change influences how a person will vote .

for example , 67 percent of respondents , including 48 percent of republicans and 72 percent of independents , said they were less likely to vote for a candidate who said that human-caused climate change is a hoax.the results came as climate change was emerging as a source of debate in the coming presidential campaign.in 2012 , all the republican presidential candidates but one - jon m. huntsman jr. - questioned or denied the science that determined that humans caused global warming , and opposed policies to curb greenhouse gas emissions .

washington - a cascade of events suggests that 2015 could be remembered as a liberal spring : the moment when deeply divisive and consuming questions of race , sexuality and broadened access to health care were settled in quick succession , and social tolerance was cemented as a cornerstone of american public life.yet what appears , in headlines and celebrations across the country , to represent an unalloyed victory for democrats , in which lawmakers and judges alike seemed to give in to the leftward shift of public opinion , may contain an opening for the republican party to move beyond losing battles and seemingly lost causes.conservatives have , in short order , endured a series of setbacks on ideas that , for some on the right , are definitional : that marriage is between a man and a woman , that southern heritage and its symbols are to be unambivalently revered and that the federal government should play a limited role in the lives of americans.remarkably , some of these verities have been challenged not by liberals but by figures from the right.the past week and the month that preceded it have been nothing short of a rout in the culture wars .

the proposal is drawing fire from many lawmakers , especially those whose states or districts are hit hardest , as critics point to fears of a military crisis with russia and the prospect of being at war with the islamic state in iraq and syria over an extended period.a portion of the army 's 40,000-troop reduction would be achieved through attrition and adjustments to recruiting , but an undetermined number of soldiers - officers as well as enlisted - would be forced out of uniform , the army said.the army 's civilian workforce would be cut by as many as 17,000 over the same period.army officials said the plan calls for cuts at nearly every installation in 2016 and 2017 , with fort benning , georgia , and joint base elmendorf-richardson , alaska , taking the largest reductions .

more significantly , a majority of the most prominent candidates - marco rubio , scott walker , ted cruz , ben carson , rand paul and mike huckabee , for example - have said at one time or another that they oppose abortion even in the case of rape or incest , a view rejected by all previous party standard-bearers from george h. w. bush to mitt romney.in doing so , these six candidates not only pit themselves against a decisive majority of the electorate , but against a majority of republican voters.a 2011 gallup survey found that 59 percent of self-identified anti-abortion republican-leaning voters agreed that abortion should be legal ` when the pregnancy has been caused by rape or incest .

` equally salient , 15 of the current republican presidential candidates , including jeb bush , chris christie and carly fiorina , contend that life begins at conception.this stance exposes all 15 to a politically costly debate over contraception , in which they would have to choose between alienating their anti-abortion backers or the estimated six-plus million women using intrauterine devices and the roughly three million women who have taken the morning after pill in the past year following unprotected sexual intercourse .

the potential political fallout from a threat to contraception can be seen in the fact that half of the 6.6 million pregnancies in the united states in 2008 were unintended , according to the guttmacher institute , which supports reproductive rights.virtually every major group opposed to abortion takes the position that life begins at fertilization .

anti-abortion organizations have received support from a number of doctors and researchers who share their belief that life begins at fertilization.jim sedlak , vice president of the american life league , outlined this position in an email responding to my inquiry : by this logic , a presidential candidate seeking to live up to the standards set by sedlak and others in the anti-abortion community must then agree that the iud and morning after pill cause abortions.the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists disputes this argument .

strict abortion opponents object to four of the 20 - two ` morning after pills , ' plan b and ella , and two intrauterine devices , paragard and mirena - in the belief that these methods prevent eggs that have been successfully fertilized by sperm from implanting on the wall of the uterus.on march 25 , 2014 , in the hobby lobby decision , the supreme court ruled that since ` owners of three closely held for-profit corporations have sincere christian beliefs that life begins at conception and that it would violate their religion to facilitate access to contraceptive drugs or devices that operate after that point , ' these companies may refuse to provide coverage for these four means of contraception.there is disagreement about whether iuds interfere with the implantation of a fertilized egg .

to win the presidency , republicans clearly need to improve their numbers among women , but their approach on reproductive issues appears likely to make that goal difficult.further compounding the hurdles facing republicans are the party 's current drive to defund planned parenthood , and the sustained effort to reduce the number of abortion clinics in republican-controlled states.this effort includes legislation effectively closing such clinics by requiring , in the case of texas , that ' a physician performing or inducing an abortion must , on the date the abortion is performed , have active admitting privileges at a hospital that is located not further than 30 miles from the location at which the abortion is performed , ' and that abortion facilities must meet the ` minimum standards for ambulatory surgical centers ' ; requiring women to undergo sometimes invasive ultrasound procedures before being allowed to have an abortion ; and imposing restrictions on abortion coverage in private health insurance plans.the conflicts over reproductive rights within both the republican party and within the social conservative movement are inevitable .

simi valley , calif. - determined to prove their mettle , several republican presidential candidates showed new aggressiveness in lacing into donald j. trump on wednesday night , seeking to elevate themselves as leaders of substance and shake up a race that mr. trump has dominated all summer.while moderators at the cnn debate tried repeatedly to pit one republican after another against mr. trump , the candidates fought to break out of that dynamic , with carly fiorina emerging as an especially tenacious combatant who provided some of the few moments where mr. trump looked uncomfortable.the debate covered a broad range of subjects - immigration , the nuclear deal with iran , same-sex marriage , federal financing for planned parenthood - and was more inclusive than the first debate last month , allowing each of the 11 candidates to engage through a nearly three-hour forum that tested their endurance.still , some of the most memorable interactions centered on loaded confrontations with mr. trump .

since 1964 , the republican party has become , in effect , a white party.the 1964 election began the realignment from democrat to republican of the eleven states of the former confederacy -- including the deep south of south carolina , georgia , alabama , louisiana and mississippi - the region most opposed to civil rights and voting rights for black americans.in the wake of the 1964 johnson-goldwater contest , the national democratic party became identified with racial and ethnic liberalism.by 1981-82 , in large part because of the enfranchisement of blacks after passage of the 1965 voting rights act , southern democrats , once the hard-core backers of segregation , moved sharply to the left on racial issues .

when ready for hillary , a pro-hillary rodham clinton ` super pac , ' wanted to take out a million-dollar loan five months before it planned to go out of business , it turned to a bank that was founded to guard the savings of new york city garment workers.when the democracy alliance , an influential club of liberal donors , sought to recruit members in advance of the 2016 elections , the bank 's president helped to make introductions.and when workers-rights groups wanted to embarrass walmart and the gap for unsafe working conditions at factories supplying their stores , amalgamated bank , which manages $ 40 billion in pension fund assets , stepped in again , rounding up fellow investors to warn the companies that they could face lawsuits and shareholder actions.four years after nearly collapsing amid the financial crisis , amalgamated has aggressively carved out a position as the left 's private banker , leveraging deep connections with the democratic establishment to expand rapidly in a niche long dominated by larger but less nimble financial institutions.the bank 's rise has been driven not only by the pace and complexity of modern campaigns , which demand increasingly specialized financial services , but by their vastly expanded scale : billion-dollar presidential campaigns are expected for both parties in 2016 , bolstered by super pacs raising hundreds of millions of dollars more.and with republican outside groups raising substantially more than their left-leaning counterparts this year , democratic strategists viewed amalgamated as a tool to leverage the financial clout of labor unions and left-leaning philanthropists.founded and still principally owned by labor unions , the 92-year-old bank has signed up hundreds of new political clients , including most of the democratic party 's major committees , the progressive organizations that align with them , and several of their top senate recruits.this spring , amalgamated scored its biggest coup yet , winning the main business for mrs. clinton 's presidential campaign , which is likely to raise a billion dollars or more.campaign clients have access to a 24-hour concierge service , staffed by veterans of president obama 's campaigns , to handle last-minute media buys or reconcile election paperwork.because it knows their donor world , amalgamated is willing to advance cash on new contributions , almost immediately .

`` a democrat familiar with biden 's deliberations said recent discussions have focused on whether biden 's family would be ready to pursue a third presidential campaign only months after the death of the vice president 's son , beau biden.also under consideration is whether biden can meet the basic criteria to be a serious contender , such as whether he would have a plausible path to victory in the campaign and whether he would be able to raise enough money to be competitive.the democrat spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the private conversations.biden 's trip to florida , one of the nation 's premiere campaign battleground states , includes meetings with jewish leaders on thursday who are skeptical of obama 's effort to win support for the nuclear deal with iran.he then heads to pittsburgh to march in a labor day parade on monday with afl-cio president richard trumka , who met privately with the vice president last week and says `` the field is still wide open '' if biden decides to run.the travels mark the latest chapter in biden 's deliberations , which have included private discussions with family members and longtime aides at his delaware home and a naval observatory meeting with massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren , a popular liberal whose endorsement would be coveted by any democratic candidate.warren said wednesday that she and biden had `` a good long rambly policy conversation '' at the naval observatory .

in the command centers of republican presidential campaigns , aides have drawn comfort from the belief that donald j. trump 's dominance in the polls is a political summer fling , like herman cain in 2011 - an unsustainable boomlet dependent on megawatt celebrity , narrow appeal and unreliable surveys of americans with a spotty record of actually voting in primaries.a growing body of evidence suggests that may be wishful thinking.a review of public polling , extensive interviews with a host of his supporters in two states and a new private survey that tracks voting records all point to the conclusion that mr. trump has built a broad , demographically and ideologically diverse coalition , constructed around personality , not substance , that bridges demographic and political divides .

curious about the republican primary landscape , the firm decided to see what it could learn from its own survey , at first for internal research purposes.unlike most public polls , civis 's relied on a list of registered voters that included their voting histories , allowing it to measure mr. trump 's support among those who regularly cast ballots in primary elections.the survey , which was conducted on landlines aug. 10 through wednesday and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points , showed mr. trump 's support at 16 percent among registered voters who identified as republicans .

kabul , afghanistan - after suffering setbacks and heavy casualties at the hands of the taliban in 2014 , afghan security forces came into this year with what afghan and western officials acknowledge were relatively modest goals : hang on till the end of the fighting season without major collapses.but with months of heavy fighting still ahead , 2015 is already shaping up to be worse for the afghan army and the national police , even as president obama is set to begin deliberating this year on whether to follow through with a complete withdrawal of the united states military assistance mission here in 2016 .

the forces are struggling to maintain a stalemate : an at-least token government presence in the hundreds of district capitals handed over by departing nato combat troops.several afghan officers described desertion as such a problem that soldiers and police officers in some critical areas had simply been barred from returning home on leave , keeping them on the front lines for months straight.and after a casualty rate last year that the previous american commander called unsustainable , the numbers this year are even worse : up more than 50 percent compared with the first six months of 2014 .

about 4,100 afghan soldiers and police officers have been killed and about 7,800 wounded , according to statistics provided by an official with the american-led coalition here.a range of interviews with army and police commanders and regional government officials in crucial battleground areas indicated that even though the afghan forces have nominally met their goal of maintaining a presence in every city and all but a very few district centers , they are often functionally penned in by the taliban , rarely mounting patrols , much less taking territory back.at the same time , they say the insurgents have increased their influence in many areas , even near cities , giving them the ability to move freely and mount intensified attacks on the afghan forces .

` the top american commander in afghanistan , gen. john f. campbell , who is to report to mr. obama in the fall with his recommendations on the future of the united states mission here , has praised the afghan forces for their continued resilience , saying they have continued to be able to inflict heavy casualties on the taliban.some of the heaviest challenges fall to the various afghan police forces , whose reported 183,000 members are stretched over vast portions of rugged afghan territory.in bati kot district , a dangerous stretch of eastern nangarhar province , one upbeat police sergeant , muhammad daud , described how in the past 18 months , his six-man outpost - a fortified hut with a flag flying over it - had suffered only one man killed and another wounded.that was relatively good fortune , sergeant daud said , and it was provided by the checkpoints in both directions down the road that left him insulated from the worst .

what makes the account particularly useful to cynical legislators is that it is an off-budget fund that allows them to increase defense spending and break the caps they agreed to while insisting that they remain as fiscally upright as ever.disregarding the distinction between the normal defense budget and war spending in this way ` would set the stage for o.c.o. to become a permanent slush fund for defense ' and set a dangerous precedent , according to the nonpartisan committee for a responsible federal budget .

right now , for instance , america is facing serious new security threats , including islamic state forces marauding across iraq and syria , and there is every reason for the country to rethink the appropriate level of defense spending.yet those who argue for funneling billions more to the pentagon stand on very shaky ground when billions of dollars have been squandered on troubled weapons like the f-35 fighter jet , when billions more have been lost to waste and corruption in afghanistan , and when the budget proposals from both mr. obama and congress waste billions more on an overgrown nuclear arsenal.meanwhile , congress has consistently refused to finance the state department at the level needed to show a commitment to robust diplomacy through its staff , embassies and programs promoting democracy , trade , and the resolution of numerous conflicts around the world.if lawmakers want to raise defense spending , they should address those issues first and then honestly own up to the fact that any major increase would require a significant and transparent rewriting of past agreements .

washington - president obama 's landmark agreement with china to cut greenhouse gas pollution is a bet by the president and democrats that on the issue of climate change , american voters are far ahead of washington 's warring factions and that the environment will be a winning cause in the 2016 presidential campaign.a variety of polls show that a majority of american voters now believe that climate change is occurring , are worried about it , and support candidates who back policies to stop it .

and they were having the intended effect.the share of registered voters in the state who were black climbed to 22.5 percent in 2014 , from 19.4 percent in 2004 , according to testimony by allan j. lichtman , a professor of political history at american university , achieving parity with the black share of the overall population.over the same period , the white share of registered voters fell , to 71 percent in 2014 , from 77.9 percent in 2004 .

washington - the national security agency has used its bulk domestic phone records program to search for operatives from the government of iran and ` associated terrorist organizations ' - not just al qaeda and its allies - according to a document obtained by the new york times.the document also shows that a february 2010 order from the foreign intelligence surveillance court for the program listed at&t and sprint as involved in it .

a leaked 2013 court order for the program was addressed only to a verizon subsidiary.the inclusion of iran and allied terrorist groups - presumably the shiite group hezbollah - and the confirmation of the names of other participating companies add new details to public understanding of the once-secret program .

the bush administration created the program to try to find hidden terrorist cells on domestic soil after the attacks of sept. 11 , 2001 , and government officials have justified it by using al qaeda as an example.the disclosure of the new details comes at a time of debates over a proposed agreement to drop sanctions against iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program , and about n.s.a. surveillance and the role of american communications companies.in june , congress enacted a law that will ban the systematic collection of domestic phone records after november , and create a replacement program for analyzing links between callers in search of associates of terrorism suspects without the government 's keeping the bulk data.the document disclosing new information about the program is an august 2010 letter from the justice department to judge john bates , then the presiding judge of the intelligence court .

confusion among european leaders about how to deal with the crisis raises questions about the political unity that is essential to the survival of the eurozone.these factors could undermine the positive effects of the bond-buying stimulus program , known as quantitative easing , that the european central bank began in march as a way to pump money into the eurozone economy and force down market interest rates.as a result , some analysts , so far apparently a minority , expect mr. draghi to send a strong signal on thursday that the central bank 's governing council is ready to step up its bond purchases and continue them longer than currently planned.but any talk of more stimulus would reawaken tensions on the governing council between those who think the central bank has already done too much and those who favor aggressive , pre-emptive action .

although there 's little evidence of a crime wave outside of a few major cities where homicides have increased , the political rationale seems obvious : the candidates are playing to the g.o.p. base , a normal part of the primary season.another possibility , though , is that republicans are also still searching for the best angle of attack against hillary rodham clinton and the democrats , who remain narrow betting market favorites in 2016 .

mikulski 's decision came a day after mr. coons and senator bob casey of pennsylvania and several democrats in the house also announced they would support the deal.with momentum on their side , the white house and senate democrats next week hope to find seven more votes to filibuster the republican resolution of disapproval , something that enrages republicans , who made ample use of the filibuster when in the minority.senators mark s. kirk , republican of illinois , and robert menendez , democrat of new jersey , both opponents of the current iran accord , introduced legislation this year that would extend the iran sanctions act , which expires at the end of 2016 , for another decade.while most lawmakers understand the need to have legal authority to ` snap back ' any sanctions that are lifted , republicans would most likely move to enforce those sanctions , putting democrats in a bind in an election year by pushing for a vote on legislation to punish iran for killing americans and israelis , and for supporting hezbollah , leaving the president little choice but to veto because if he signed it , the iranians would say they are no longer bound by broader agreement.even if these sanctions are never reimposed , republicans could use the issue in an effort to divide democrats in 2016 .

in the clinton years , whites favored republicans over democrats by 4.1 percentage points ; in the bush years , the republican advantage grew to 5.4 points ; in the obama years , the republican party has pulled ahead by 9.5 points.extensive polling has already demonstrated that some of the states considered reliable sources of democratic or republican electoral college votes are shifting to a more competitive status.in georgia , two democratic candidates , michelle nunn , who is the daughter of former senator sam nunn , and jason carter , a grandson of jimmy carter , have mounted surprisingly strong bids for senate and governor , respectively , against david purdue , a republican businessman , and nathan deal , the incumbent republican governor.win or lose , nunn and carter 's respectable showing in a low turnout midterm election is virtually certain to turn georgia into a democratic presidential target in 2016 .

at the same time , if two republican governors , scott walker in wisconsin and rick snyder in michigan , win re-election , these two midwestern states will shift in 2016 from the reliably democratic column to competitive status.details down to precinct level results in all the competitive races this year will be studied closely by party officials and political scientists to determine whether republicans have caught up with democrats in the world of big-data , high-tech voter mobilization.in the last two presidential elections , the obama campaign and democratic interest groups remained far ahead of republicans in the so-called ground war techniques of locating favorable voters wherever they can be found , registering citizens likely to be supportive , and making sure every supporter casts a ballot , in person , by mail , or through early voting processes.in the current contest , however , both the republican national committee and the network of conservative groups allied with the koch brothers have invested millions in microtargeting innovation , and are attempting to level the playing field.estimates of the effectiveness of microtargeting vary , but , if the 2016 election is close , new digital strategies developed in recent years to marshal favorable voters will be crucial to the outcome.as the election campaign comes to a close , polls suggest that republican candidates vulnerable to ` war on women ' accusations have learned how to successfully revamp.senate candidates in virginia , north carolina and colorado have adopted the strategy of signaling support for women 's reproductive rights by pointedly endorsing access to over-the-counter ` morning after ' contraceptive pills.representative cory gardner , the republican challenging senator mark udall of colorado , has not only called for the availability of the day-after pill , he has repudiated his past support for a ` personhood ' constitutional amendment that would effectively ban all abortions .

washington - in the immediate aftermath of sept. 11 , 2001 , justice department officials , concerned that another attack was imminent , swiftly arrested many people , some of whom were only remotely suspected of having ties to terrorism.many suspicions proved unfounded .

and the frenzied response soon gave way to a more patient approach that encouraged f.b.i. agents to watch suspects as long as possible before making arrests , so that they could gain valuable intelligence about al qaeda 's networks.now , confronted with efforts by the islamic state to inspire americans to commit violence , the authorities have changed their strategy again.in recent months , the f.b.i. has apprehended people suspected of being islamic state sympathizers soon after they came onto the government 's radar .

the f.b.i. has arrested and charged at least 25 people in the past three months with having ties to the islamic state or other terrorist groups , compared with 20 people arrested over the previous year , according to court records.american counterterrorism officials are so concerned about the threat from the islamic state that in june the f.b.i. had so many people under surveillance in terrorism-related investigations that supervisors reassigned criminal squads to monitor terrorism suspects , according to f.b.i. officials .

a basic fact often gets lost in the propaganda that swirls around voting laws in this country : between one-quarter and one-third of all eligible voters - more than 50 million americans - are not registered.that alarming statistic is the backdrop to efforts by republicans in recent years to pass state laws that restrict ballot access , a recent democratic campaign to push back against those laws , and a bold set of proposals that hillary rodham clinton laid out thursday afternoon in a speech at texas southern university , a historically black college in houston.in addition to pushing needed and long-overdue reforms , the speech highlighted the yawning gulf on voting rights between mrs. clinton and the republican candidates for the white house , many of whom have been cynically committed to making voting harder for the most vulnerable citizens .

`` to wreak havoc on washington , it takes a leader who 's got real solutions , '' walker said.he said that starting his first day as president , he 'd require federal employee unions to disclose and certify the portion of union dues used for political activity and prohibit the government from withholding that amount in paychecks of its workers.doing so would protect workers from being forced to give money to political candidates they do n't support , walker said .

`` union dues are used for negotiating with management on better working conditions , protecting employees from discrimination and retaliation in the workplace , and educating lawmakers and congressional staff from both sides of the aisle on issues of vital importance to employees , '' cox said.while union gifts to federal candidates must be drawn from voluntary member contributions , compulsory dues can be used for political activities such as polling , voter education and get-out-the-vote efforts - activities that can often be steered to benefit favored candidates.walker is trying to get his campaign back on track after a lackluster performance in the first gop debate a month ago , a series of statements he 's had to clarify or back away from , and the rise of donald trump.after touring a reagan museum on the eureka campus , walker gave two thumbs up to a college official and said he hoped the speech `` would give us momentum going into wednesday .

in 2011 , just six weeks after taking office , walker proposed effectively ending collective bargaining for nearly all public workers in wisconsin.that led to massive protests as large as 100,000 people and made the state the center of a national debate over worker rights.anger over that law , and a variety of other initiatives walker and the republican-led legislature pushed through led to a petition drive that drew more than 900,000 signatures , forcing walker to stand for a recall election in 2012 .

he won , becoming the first governor in u.s. history to defeat such an effort.in march walker signed a law that prohibits private-sector unions in wisconsin from requiring workers to join and pay dues as a condition of their employment.his latest plan will be fleshed out monday in las vegas as part of a weekly release of `` day one '' promises detailing what he would do when taking office.walker has already said he plans to send a bill to congress seeking to repeal the health care law and replace it with his own alternative , undo the iranian nuclear arms deal and end the practices of `` sanctuary cities '' where local officials have decided not to use their police to enforce some federal immigration laws.the promises are similar to a campaign ploy walker used when first running for milwaukee county executive in 2002 , printing up pledge cards of promises to voters .
