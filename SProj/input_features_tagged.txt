a fast talking and born again veteran of conservative politics with experience in washington texas and california mr lane 60 travels the country trying to persuade evangelical clergy members to become politically active his hope is that the politicized pastors will help mobilize congregations that have been disheartened by the repeated failure of socially conservative candidates and by a party that has softened its opposition to same sex marriage it is an organizing approach far different from those in the days when larger than life leaders like the moral majority founder jerry falwell who died in 2007 or pat robertson now 84 could activate evangelical voters simply by anointing a candidate but close observers of evangelicals and their political involvement say mr lane is emblematic of a new generation of evangelical leaders who draw local support or exert influence through niche issues or their own networks unlike political operatives such as ralph reed the former executive director of the christian coalition who helped elect george w bush before becoming ensnared in the jack abramoff lobbying scandal mr lane does not have an extensive organization what mr lane a former public relations man does have going for him is a decentralized landscape in which a determined believer with an extensive network of ground level evangelical leaders and a limitless capacity for talking on the phone can exert influence on republican presidential candidates eager to reach evangelical voters

and gov chris christie of new jersey did well in the final hour other than an off note when he silenced mrs fiorina ben carson who rose in the polls after the fox news debate last month had some strong moments but a tortured response on his view about the decision to go to war with iraq did n t help his case as for the rest they mostly faded into the shadows of mr reagan s air force one plane behind them

bush in particular may pose as a reasonable thoughtful type credulous reporters even describe him as a policy wonk but his actual economic platform which relies on the magic of tax cuts to deliver a doubling of america s growth rate is pure supply side voodoo and here s what s interesting : all indications are that mr bush s attacks on mr trump are falling flat because the republican base does n t actually share the republican establishment s economic delusions the thing is we did n t really know that until mr trump came along

when ready for hillary a pro hillary rodham clinton super pac wanted to take out a million dollar loan five months before it planned to go out of business it turned to a bank that was founded to guard the savings of new york city garment workers when the democracy alliance an influential club of liberal donors sought to recruit members in advance of the 2016 elections the bank s president helped to make introductions and when workers rights groups wanted to embarrass walmart and the gap for unsafe working conditions at factories supplying their stores amalgamated bank which manages 40 billion in pension fund assets stepped in again rounding up fellow investors to warn the companies that they could face lawsuits and shareholder actions four years after nearly collapsing amid the financial crisis amalgamated has aggressively carved out a position as the left s private banker leveraging deep connections with the democratic establishment to expand rapidly in a niche long dominated by larger but less nimble financial institutions the bank s rise has been driven not only by the pace and complexity of modern campaigns which demand increasingly specialized financial services but by their vastly expanded scale : billion dollar presidential campaigns are expected for both parties in 2016 bolstered by super pacs raising hundreds of millions of dollars more and with republican outside groups raising substantially more than their left leaning counterparts this year democratic strategists viewed amalgamated as a tool to leverage the financial clout of labor unions and left leaning philanthropists founded and still principally owned by labor unions the 92 year old bank has signed up hundreds of new political clients including most of the democratic party s major committees the progressive organizations that align with them and several of their top senate recruits this spring amalgamated scored its biggest coup yet winning the main business for mrs clinton s presidential campaign which is likely to raise a billion dollars or more campaign clients have access to a 24 hour concierge service staffed by veterans of president obama s campaigns to handle last minute media buys or reconcile election paperwork because it knows their donor world amalgamated is willing to advance cash on new contributions almost immediately

bush in particular may pose as a reasonable thoughtful type credulous reporters even describe him as a policy wonk but his actual economic platform which relies on the magic of tax cuts to deliver a doubling of america s growth rate is pure supply side voodoo and here s what s interesting : all indications are that mr bush s attacks on mr trump are falling flat because the republican base does n t actually share the republican establishment s economic delusions the thing is we did n t really know that until mr trump came along

 the document is undergirded by two major presidential initiatives that have virtually no chance in congress : large tax increases on multinational corporations and the rich and a comprehensive immigration law that would lift the economy with millions of newly legalized taxpaying workers the proceeds of those initiatives would pay for free community college more generous child care subsidies and education tax credits paid sick leave expanded unemployment benefits and tax credits for two earner middle class couples among other offerings the white house even did away with the usual plain blue budget document cover for a gritty black and white photo of the tappan zee bridge in new york making vivid the president s emphasis on a 21st century infrastructure that creates jobs for thousands of construction workers and engineers connects hard working americans to their jobs and makes it easier for businesses to transport goods as mr obama wrote in the opening budget message the push reflects the degree to which mr obama emerged from last year s midterm election losses determined to reinforce rather than scale back his belief that the government should play a fundamental role in spreading economic prosperity

when ready for hillary a pro hillary rodham clinton super pac wanted to take out a million dollar loan five months before it planned to go out of business it turned to a bank that was founded to guard the savings of new york city garment workers when the democracy alliance an influential club of liberal donors sought to recruit members in advance of the 2016 elections the bank s president helped to make introductions and when workers rights groups wanted to embarrass walmart and the gap for unsafe working conditions at factories supplying their stores amalgamated bank which manages 40 billion in pension fund assets stepped in again rounding up fellow investors to warn the companies that they could face lawsuits and shareholder actions four years after nearly collapsing amid the financial crisis amalgamated has aggressively carved out a position as the left s private banker leveraging deep connections with the democratic establishment to expand rapidly in a niche long dominated by larger but less nimble financial institutions the bank s rise has been driven not only by the pace and complexity of modern campaigns which demand increasingly specialized financial services but by their vastly expanded scale : billion dollar presidential campaigns are expected for both parties in 2016 bolstered by super pacs raising hundreds of millions of dollars more and with republican outside groups raising substantially more than their left leaning counterparts this year democratic strategists viewed amalgamated as a tool to leverage the financial clout of labor unions and left leaning philanthropists founded and still principally owned by labor unions the 92 year old bank has signed up hundreds of new political clients including most of the democratic party s major committees the progressive organizations that align with them and several of their top senate recruits this spring amalgamated scored its biggest coup yet winning the main business for mrs clinton s presidential campaign which is likely to raise a billion dollars or more campaign clients have access to a 24 hour concierge service staffed by veterans of president obama s campaigns to handle last minute media buys or reconcile election paperwork because it knows their donor world amalgamated is willing to advance cash on new contributions almost immediately
