A former aide to Hillary Rodham Clinton who helped set up the server that housed Mrs. Clinton's private email account plans to invoke his Fifth Amendment right in response to congressional questions about the email practices, according to two people who have been briefed on the matter.The former aide, Bryan Pagliano, was subpoenaed to testify before a House committee, but a lawyer for Mr. Pagliano has told the panel that his client will assert his right to remain silent and decline to answer their questions.The subpoena was issued by the House committee investigating the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya. As part of its inquiry, the panel is examining Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email account while she was secretary of state, which shielded her correspondences from congressional inquiries.Mr. Pagliano was the information technology director for Mrs. Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign and then worked at the State Department as an adviser and special projects manager for its chief technology officer, according to his LinkedIn page. He left the State Department in February 2013, the same month Mrs. Clinton stepped down as secretary of state.It is not clear why Mr. Pagliano is refusing to answer questions about the server. The F.B.I. is investigating how classified information was handled in connection with the account, but no evidence has surfaced that Mr. Pagliano had anything to do with those materials.Mr. Pagliano's lawyer, Mark MacDougall, declined to comment.A Clinton campaign aide said that Mr. Pagliano's decision was 'both understandable and disappointing to us, because we believe he has every reason to be transparent about his I.T. assistance.''We had hoped Bryan would also agree to answer any questions from the committee and had recently encouraged him to grant the committee's request for an interview,' the aide said.The aide added: 'Bryan is an utter professional and a wonderful young man who does not live in the public eye and understandably may not wish to be drawn into a political spectacle.'The Republican-controlled committee had planned to call Mr. Pagliano to testify behind closed doors, similar to the way it has interviewed some top aides to Mrs. Clinton and Americans who were in Benghazi.Even if Mr. Pagliano does not back down, the panel will probably still call him to testify and force him to invoke the Fifth Amendment in person.Mr. Pagliano's response to the subpoena was first reported by The Washington PostMrs. Clinton's longtime lawyer and adviser, Cheryl Mills, is scheduled to testify before the committee on Thursday. The panel wants to ask her about how the email account was set up and how Mrs. Clinton decided which emails she should hand over to the State Department in response to its request last year for government records from the account.Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, 'had made every effort to answer questions and be as helpful as possible and has encouraged her aides, current and former, to do the same, including Bryan Pagliano.''In fact, two of those aides are due to testify this week, and she is eager to testify in a public hearing in October,' Mr. Merrill said.The ranking Democratic member of the House committee, Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, defended Mr. Pagliano's decision.'Although multiple legal experts agree there is no evidence of criminal activity, it is certainly understandable that this witness's attorneys advised him to assert his Fifth Amendment rights, especially given the onslaught of wild and unsubstantiated accusations by Republican presidential candidates, members of Congress and others based on false leaks about the investigation,' Mr. Cummings said.'Their insatiable desire to derail Secretary Clinton's presidential campaign at all costs has real consequences for any serious congressional effort,' he added.Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said on Wednesday that the government should respect the beliefs of the Kentucky county clerk who has denied marriage licenses to same-sex couples, arguing that society needs to accommodate public officials who object to carrying out duties they say violate their religious beliefs. 'We should seek a balance between government's responsibility to abide by the laws of our republic and allowing people to stand by their religious convictions,' Mr. Rubio said in a statement to The New York Times, his first public remarks on the case.'While the clerk's office has a governmental duty to carry out the law,' he added, 'there should be a way to protect the religious freedom and conscience rights of individuals working in the office.'The clerk, Kim Davis, of Rowan County, Ky., has turned away gay men and lesbians who want to marry after the Supreme Court in June established a nationwide right to same-sex marriage. Despite numerous rulings against her, including one this week from the Supreme Court, she has remained defiant. Ms. Davis will face a federal judge on Thursday morning who will decide whether to declare her in contempt of court.Many Republicans have tried to move past the heated emotions over same-sex marriage, hopeful that the Supreme Court ruling made the issue largely moot. But the debate is resurfacing as many conservatives push for exemptions for people like Ms. Davis on religious liberty grounds. Mr. Rubio favors broad religious exemptions. 'Marriage is the most important institution in our society, and I believe it should be between one man and one woman,' he said in his statement. 'Our nation was founded on the human right of religious freedom, and our elected leaders have a duty to protect that right by ensuring that no one is forced by the government to violate their conscience and deeply held religious beliefs about traditional marriage.' Responding to growing pressure from party donors and officials to dissuade Donald J. Trump from mounting an independent campaign for president, the Republican National Committee on Wednesday asked each of the party's presidential candidates to sign a statement vowing not to run as a third-party candidate.With little warning, committee officials called and emailed campaign representatives requesting that they put in writing what every candidate, except for Mr. Trump, has already pledged to do.'I ______ affirm that if I do not win the 2016 Republican nomination for president of the United States, I will endorse the 2016 Republican presidential nominee regardless of who it is,' the document, on R.N.C. letterhead, states. 'I further pledge that I will not seek to run as an independent or write-in candidate nor will I seek or accept the nomination for president of any other party.'The document, first disclosed by Politico, was emailed to the campaigns under the subject line 'pledge' and includes a space for the candidates to sign and for the R.N.C.'s chairman, Reince Priebus, to witness.That there is a notarylike space for Mr. Priebus suggests that he is in conversations with Mr. Trump about signing the pledge. Also lending credence to the possibility that the document had been written after consultations with Mr. Trump, one campaign said that the R.N.C. told it that the pledge would not be released 'unless all 17 signed it.'There are 17 major candidates seeking the Republican presidential nomination, and only Mr. Trump has refused to pledge to support the party's nominee next year.Republicans fear that a third-party candidacy by Mr. Trump would siphon conservative votes from their nominee and make it easier for Democrats to retain the presidencyMr. Trump has said that he thought he was singled out at the first Republican debate when a Fox anchor asked each of the candidates to pledge to support the party's nominee. He was the only one who refused to do so, though he recently said he planned to announce a decision soon about whether he would rule out such a bid.By requiring each of the hopefuls to sign the oath, Mr. Priebus seems to be attempting to avoid making Mr. Trump feel isolated.Mr. Priebus, according to Republicans briefed on his schedule, is expected on Thursday to be in New York City, where Mr. Trump's campaign is based. New York-based Republicans said that the state's party chairman, Edward F. Cox, told people that he was invited to a 2 p.m. event in Manhattan with Mr. Trump and Mr. Priebus.A spokesman confirmed that Mr. Trump was scheduled to meet with Mr. Priebus on Thursday, but his campaign would not comment on whether he would sign the pledge. A spokesman for Mr. Priebus did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.Even if Mr. Trump does sign the pledge, it is a party-produced document and is not legally binding. The national party's sudden move comes as some state parties, including early-voting South Carolina, have moved to adopt similar loyalty oaths for candidates to participate in their primaries or caucuses.Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina, who won accolades for swiftly moving to remove the Confederate flag from the grounds of the state capitol after the June massacre of nine black churchgoers, sharply criticized the Black Lives Matter movement on Wednesday.Citing the unrest that followed the police-involved deaths of unarmed black men in Ferguson, Mo., and Baltimore, Ms. Haley, a Republican, said the swelling African-American movement protesting  police misconduct was imperiling black lives and property.'Most of the people who now live in terror because local police are too intimidated to do their jobs are black,' Ms. Haley said at a luncheon in Washington.  'Black lives do matter, and they have been disgracefully jeopardized by the movement that has laid waste to Ferguson and Baltimore.'Ms. Haley contrasted the rioting in those communities with what she described as the reconciliation that took place in South Carolina after the death in April of Walter Scott, who was shot in the back as he ran from a police officer, and the killing of nine members of the Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston.She noted that Mr. Scott's killing prompted South Carolina to mandate that police officers wear body cameras, the first state in the country to do so, and she recalled her effort to build support for taking down the Confederate flag.'Some people think that you have to yell and scream in order to make a difference,' Ms. Haley said. 'That's not true. Often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume level.'For Ms. Haley, at 43 the youngest governor in the country, her address to the National Press Club represented the next phase of what is essentially an audition to be the Republican vice-presidential nominee next year. Her response to the Charleston killings lifted her national profile and prompted many in the party to suggest that Ms. Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants, should be on the short list of the eventual presidential nominee.  Ms. Haley did little to dissuade such talk during a question-and-answer session after her remarks, stating that she was focused on her state for now but that if the party standard-bearer next year approached her about joining the ticket, 'of course I will sit down and talk.'Her 28-minute address illustrated how, in positioning herself for higher national prominence, she is trying to balance her conservative views with a more inclusive brand of politics that could make her attractive in a general election.So, with a handful of advisers and South Carolina political hands watching closely, Ms. Haley mixed harsh words for some black protesters and a defense of her state's voter identification law with a call for Republicans to be more welcoming to minorities and for everybody engaged in politics to listen to one another.She also toed a delicate line when asked after her remarks about Donald J. Trump's candidacy, calling him 'a friend' but making clear that she did not approve of his trademark personal insults.Arguing that her own political success illustrated the South's progress on race, Ms. Haley said voters should be required to show proof of identity to protect 'the integrity of democracy.'But, noting that she had gotten to know the Rev. Jesse Jackson in the aftermath of the Charleston shootings, the governor pledged to 'stand shoulder-to-shoulder' with the longtime civil rights activist if he wanted to lead a voter registration drive in South Carolina.'I want to make it easy for everyone who is rightfully eligible to vote to do so,' she said.  Asked in a brief interview after her speech about the additional voting restrictions some states have adopted, such as ending early vote periods or curtailing Sunday voting, Ms. Haley said that South Carolina allowed only absentee votes outside Election Day and that there had been no effort to limit those ballots.  As for her own party, Ms. Haley said that Republicans must change their tone if not their policies.'The problem for our party is that our approach often appears cold and unwelcoming to minorities,' she said.  'That is shameful, and it has to change.'But asked if Mr. Trump's attacks on immigrants and support for ending birthright citizenship represented the party she had in mind, the governor was cautious.'He has tapped into a frustration that's very real,' she said, but added that Mr. Trump's personal attacks on critics did not represent 'who we are as Republicans.' As for whether she would be willing to serve as Mr. Trump's running mate, Ms. Haley joked to the audience: 'That is so wrong, whoever sent that question up.'A day after taking steps to warm relations with Hispanics, Donald J. Trump may have taken a step backward Wednesday when he suggested that Jeb Bush was setting a bad example by speaking Spanish.'He's a nice man. But he should really set the example by speaking English while in the United States,' Mr. Trump told Breitbart News in an interview.This week, at an event in Miami, Mr. Bush said, 'El hombre no es conservador,'  making the case that Mr. Trump is not a conservative. The remark was part of Mr. Bush's broader effort to aggressively confront Mr. Trump after months of weathering criticism from the billionaire tycoon.Mr. Bush's campaign manager, Danny Diaz, took to Twitter on Wednesday to scold Mr. Trump for being against the Spanish language and to accuse him of trying to destroy the Republican Party with his divisive language.Mr. Bush, a former governor of Florida whose wife, Columba, was born in Mexico, is fluent in Spanish and speaks it at home. Republicans and some Democrats, however, have made promotion of the English language a part of their immigration plans in the past. Mr. Bush proposes on his campaign website that learning English should be a requirement for those immigrants seeking to earn legal status in the United States.Senator Marco Rubio of Florida has also said that requirements to learn English should be strengthened, and President Obama has said that it should be part of a pathway to citizenship.For Mr. Trump, his remark Wednesday is the latest example of him saying something that could offend immigrants since he began his presidential campaign by saying that many Mexicans who enter the United States illegally are rapists and criminals. Last week'he appeared to mock Asian negotiators when he described them as saying 'we want deal.''Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York endorsed Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential bid months ago. But on Wednesday, he did not discourage Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. from entering the race.Asked if he would be 'in a bind' over whom to support if Mr. Biden were to seek the presidency, Mr. Cuomo responded, 'If he did run, I think all Democrats would be in a bind, because they'd have a choice of a number of good candidates.' 'But that's a good situation to be in, right?' he added. Speaking to reporters in Manhattan, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said there was 'a certain natural logic' to Mr. Biden's considering whether to run, given the office he now holds. 'That's a decision that nobody else can really advise you on,' he said. 'I went through this with my father, you know, and even as his son, we could talk about it, but it is a personal decision, because you have to want to do this with all your heart and soul.' 'Whatever decision he arrives at,' Mr. Cuomo added, 'I respect.' Senator Bernie Sanders is on the verge of signing a joint fund-raising agreement with the Democratic National Committee, his aides said, a week after Hillary Rodham Clinton entered such an arrangement with the party.It remains to be seen how a joint fund-raising agreement with Mr. Sanders, the Vermont independent who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, would be carried out. Mr. Sanders has never aggressively courted the types of party donors who hold major national events. But his aides indicated that he would like to help the committee build its war chest in preparation for the 2016 general election.'Bernie is committed to trying to build the resources of the party for the election since we believe Bernie will be the nominee of the Democratic Party,' said the senator's spokesman, Michael Briggs, adding that Mr. Sanders has helped his Senate colleagues raise funds in the past by appearing at events for the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee. 'The campaign will review the proposed joint fund-raising agreement with the D.N.C.,' Mr. Briggs said, 'and if there are no problems with it, then Jeff Weaver, the campaign manager, will sign it and Bernie will participate in events as the schedule allows.'A spokeswoman for the national committee, Miryam Lipper, said: 'The D.N.C. has offered to engage in joint fund-raising with all five of our announced presidential campaigns. We are in continuing conversations, including with the Sanders campaign, and we hope to create partnerships that are best for all of our candidates and the party.' Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday released plans for a $10 billion initiative to combat the escalating drug epidemic that she says has swept through rural America and has emerged as a regular concern among voters she has met in the early nominating states.'In state after state, this issue came up again and again - from so many people, from all walks of life, in small towns and big cities,' Mrs. Clinton wrote in an op-ed in The New Hampshire Union Leader.Her plan to address the nearly 23 million Americans with substance abuse problems includes helping state and local governments put in place school and community-based programs to combat drug use, expanding mental health coverage to provide long-term support and making sure more emergency medical workers carry naloxone, which can prevent death from drug overdoses.The plan includes spending $7.5 billion, partly paid for by reforming the criminal justice system, over 10 years to support federal-state partnerships to help prevent and treat drug addiction. States can receive $4 of federal support for every $1 they commit to prevention, treatment and recovery programs.The rising tide of drug use, particularly the spread of heroin in rural America, had not been an issue Mrs. Clinton initially anticipated making a priority in her presidential campaign.After serving four years as secretary of state, she seemed struck by how heroin epidemic had affected families, as voters told her about their ordeals during an early campaign stop in New Hampshire. 'We're not just 'discovering' the problem,' she wrote in the op-ed. 'But we should be saying enough is enough.'The aggressive stance on combating drug addiction comes as Mrs. Clinton has also called for criminal justice reform and rethinking long prison sentences for low-level drug offenders.'For those who commit low-level, nonviolent drug offenses, I will reorient our federal criminal justice resources away from more incarceration and toward treatment and rehabilitation,' she said. Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida made his offensive against Donald J. Trump more personal on Wednesday, highlighting his fear of germs as another reason that Republicans should reconsider their summer fling with the billionaire tycoon.'Would you rather support a candidate who strives to shake every hand everywhere or is a 'germaphobe' when it comes to shaking hands,' Mr. Bush's campaign asked in an online quiz intended to demonstrate Mr. Trump's liberal views.Mr. Trump's preference for keeping his hands clean has been well chronicled. He has called the ritual of shaking hands 'barbaric' and he wrote in 'The Art of the Comeback,' his 1997 book: 'I happen to be a clean hands freak. I feel much better after I thoroughly wash my hands, which I do as much as possible.'For Mr. Bush, the jab marks his latest attempt to hit back against Mr. Trump's constant heckling and suggestion that he 'lacks energy.' On Tuesday, the Republican from Florida released an attack ad compiling clips of Mr. Trump expressing Democratic policy positions.Mr. Trump responded on Wednesday morning, telling ABC that Mr. Bush needed to try a new approach because he has been falling in the polls.'I think he had no choice,' Mr. Trump said.He has consolidated all Republicans who think Obama is a Muslim - and that he was born in Kenya. Whatever bloc that is, that's what he's got. And I'm going for the other crowd. I'm going for the crowd that says, O.K., I think he's a Christian and born in Hawaii, but he's a bad president.'- Senator Lindsey Graham, the Republican from South Carolina who is running for president, trying to evaluate the support for Donald J. Trump in an interview on MSNBC's 'Morning Joe' program.Hillary Rodham Clinton's popularity is sinking as the spotlight on her campaign intensifies, according to a new ABC News-Washington Post poll that shows the American electorate growing more'polarized along racial lines.The survey found that 53 percent of Americans now see Mrs. Clinton unfavorably, nearly matching the nadir she reached in April 2008 during her first presidential bid. Although 45 percent still view Mrs. Clinton favorably, the bulk of her support comes from blacks and Hispanics, while whites are taking a dimmer view of her candidacy.The poll points to the negative attention surrounding her use of a private email server as secretary of state as a reason for the negative feelings.On the Republican side, Donald J. Trump is even more polarizing than Mrs. Clinton with an unfavorable score of 59 percent. He did show a small uptick in support from Hispanics, but over all his favorability among nonwhites is 17 percent, with 79 percent of that demographic viewing him negatively.Former Gov. Jeb Bush's overall favorability is slightly stronger than that of Mr. Trump. The Florida Republican'fares better with blacks and Hispanics, but his popularity with the latter group has dipped slightly, suggesting that Mr. Trump's remarks about immigration could be damaging the Republican Party more broadly.The poll had margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky often says that he campaigns where 'other Republicans aren't,' like Detroit, Alaska, and, well, on a smartphone.The Paul campaign is releasing a smartphone app on Wednesday through the Apple and Android stores, one of the few official campaign apps of 2016 aside from one from Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. It tries to offer a blend of digital mischief and communication that has come to be a hallmark of Mr. Paul's online campaign.In addition to offering calendar events, campaign news and a featured video, the app lets users post their own Rand Paul memes or create an artificial selfie with the senator to share on social media. And if they know where to tap, they can find an 'Easter egg' hidden game, a version of the 1978 arcade classic 'Space Invaders' that features Mr. Paul's torch logo shooting rockets at other campaigns' logos, blasting Donald J. Trump's 'Make America Great Again' and Jeb Bush's 'Jeb!' into pixelated embers.   A common criticism of campaign apps is that they speak only to the converted; there's no point in persuading a user who's willing to download an app.But there is use in reaching out to that base. Mr. Paul's app will send push alerts when the senator is hosting an event in the area, and notify users when he is about to vote on a bill in the Senate, asking his followers how they think he should vote.'You have a reason to download it because you can influence what happens,' said Ron Schnell, the chief technology officer of the Paul campaign and architect of the app. 'It's not just to find out about the candidate you support, it's about letting the candidate know what you think.'The first piece of content a user sees when beginning to scroll in the app, however, is not a game or news, but rather an option to donate.And should a Trump or Bush logo blow up the user-controlled Paul liberty torch in the app's hidden game, the user is chided: 'You have not defeated your inferiors! Assuage your guilt by making a donation to the campaign!'Good Wednesday morning. In their arguments against the Iran nuclear deal, some Republican candidates have mocked President Obama for calling climate change the most serious threat facing the nation. It is worth noting then that the deal's success might be assured while Mr. Obama is in the Arctic, warning of the effects of climate change.Mr. Obama may be in the wilds of Alaska, but he is on the verge of a major foreign policy victory back home: The Senate is a vote short of making it impossible for opponents to block the nuclear deal with Iran.Senators Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Chris Coons of Delaware, both Democrats, said on Tuesday that they would vote against a resolution putting Congress on record against the Iran deal, becoming the 32nd and 33rd Democrats to do so. Thirty-four votes are needed to sustain a presidential veto if the resolution of disapproval passes.Now attention is turned to the 11 Democrats who have not officially disclosed their view, several of whom are widely expected to back the agreement.Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, has public appearances on Wednesday, but indications are that he will not announce his position on the Iran deal. Other Democratic senators being watched closely include Barbara A. Mikulski of Maryland; Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, who is believed to be leaning toward supporting the deal; Mark Warner of Virginia; Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, and Gary Peters of Michigan.In the House, Democrats have maintained a steady parade in favor of the deal, and supporters of the president are optimistic they can keep Republicans from getting near the 290 votes required to override a presidential veto there. And if the House can sustain the veto, the Senate wouldn't even have to vote a second time. With the votes to sustain a veto almost in hand, some Democrats are now pushing for the party to filibuster the deal on the Senate floor, avoiding a veto fight they say could weaken the president internationally even though the agreement would still go into force without majority congressional support.- Carl HulseStay tuned throughout the day: Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates.For candidates, and potential candidates, the late-night talk shows seem to be an offshoot of the Sunday morning news shows, as Donald J. Trump is expected to soon follow Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey to 'The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon,' while Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Jeb Bush and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. are all scheduled to appear on 'The Late Show With Stephen Colbert' during his first several shows.Mr. Biden will travel to Miami on Wednesday where he will speak at the Science Center at Miami Dade College, his office says, on the importance of 'partnerships between community colleges and employers' in 'helping Americans obtain the skills they need to succeed in the work force.'In the evening, he will speak at a Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee event.Mr. Biden may not have decided whether he will run for president, but his enthusiasts are not waiting to set up the makings of a South Carolina organization should he join the race.The Draft Biden effort has settled on two well-known South Carolina Democrats to lead the initiative in the state, Inez Tenenbaum, a former state superintendent of education, and State Senator Gerald Malloy.The staff of the South Carolina draft effort, which could ultimately become Mr. Biden's 'super PAC,' will be led by Isaiah Nelson, who last year ran the coordinated campaign for the South Carolina Democratic Party.Mr. Nelson worked under Dick Harpootlian, an outspoken Biden supporter and the state Democratic Party chairman at the time, and the former executive director Amanda Loveday. Should Mr. Biden enter the race, Ms. Loveday is also expected to play a role for him in South Carolina.- Jonathan MartinLike Mr. Trump, Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, has never held elected office, but polls suggest that voters are responding to his low-key style.CNN has changed its criteria to qualify for its debate in September, a move that effectively helps candidates who have moved up in the polls since the first debate - chiefly Carly Fiorina.And Mr. Obama is in legacy-building mode in Alaska, where he has been talking about the rapidly unfolding effects of climate change and the urgent need to address it, and has been crossing some items off his bucket list.Mr. Trump, whose caustic statements on immigration have caused some controversy, took a step to try to smooth things over with Hispanics by inviting Javier Palomarez, president of the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, to his Manhattan office.While voters seem to be increasingly gravitating to Mr. Sanders's message, his candidacy raises another question: Is the nation finally ready to embrace a politician from Brooklyn? And The Times's About New York columnist Jim Dwyer writes of an encounter with Mr. Trump nearly 18 years ago that suggests his demeanor as a presidential candidate is far from new.The A.F.L.-C.I.O. has hinted it might delay its endorsement as a means in part to tilt the candidates toward more favorable positions, but Richard L. Trumka, the leader of the labor group who met privately with Mr. Biden last week, told reporters on Tuesday that he was open to an endorsement sometime before the first voting contests.Yahoo Politics takes a look at Mr. Biden's potential 2016 run for president through the lens of his previous two, 'in 1988 when he pulled out of the race amid a plagiarism controversy before voting began and 2008 when he dropped out after coming in fifth in the Iowa caucuses.'And New York magazine says that Mitt Romney is frustrated at Mr. Trump's success and how he is achieving it, which is 'restarting 'Mitt 2016' talk.'And WMUR in New Hampshire reports that Mr. Christie is releasing a new ad about the growing heroin epidemic in the state.While many other aides to Hillary Rodham Clinton are deferential in their emails to her, one former aide, Cheryl Mills, her former chief of staff, is 'the only person who says no to Hillary,' Politico reports. 'She can be brusque, sometimes responding to Clinton's questions with a simple 'y' as if she is too busy to finish typing the three-letter word.'
