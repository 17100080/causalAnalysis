CHICAGO -  As a new fiscal year opened on Wednesday, Illinois's leaders had no state budget, no hint of an agreement on the horizon, and no consensus about what all of it will mean for services to residents and for paying public employees and state contractors.Gov. Bruce Rauner, a Republican in his first term, said that state employees would work and be paid as usual, and that he planned to minimize disruptions in the state. But some Democrats, who control the state legislature, said payments to contractors and workers would stop in a matter of weeks without a budget or some special dispensation. As Wednesday progressed and lawmakers heard testimony about how a shutdown might disrupt state services, the two sides struggled even to agree on a method of temporary funding.'We've got a mess,' Mr. Rauner told state workers on Tuesday, days after he vetoed much of the Democrats' budget, which included a deficit. 'It's going to take a little while to fix.'Illinois is not alone in its budget impasse. New fiscal years began on Wednesday in most states, but leaders in at least four others, including Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and North Carolina, had yet to reach final spending plans. In about a half-dozen other states, including Connecticut, Delaware and Washington, budgets were approved only in the final days or, in some cases, the final hours.While governments routinely wrestle with budgets, experts said the number of states with unfinished plans and the amount of discord over questions of tax level, pension policy and education spending were unusual. Increasingly, states are grappling with a new array of questions in a changing climate: whether to tax online purchases, whether to expand taxes on services, and how to manage previously allowed tax credits and exemptions.'This all goes to show what intractable budget situations we have even seven years after the recession,' said Sujit M. CanagaRetna, fiscal policy manager at the Council of State Governments. 'States are still struggling to come up with revenue. The big elephant in the room - taxes - is the issue that is underlying this whole discussion. And I think we're going to see more of this going forward.'Some of the most intense fights have emerged in states with divided control of government, like Illinois. In Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, late Tuesday vetoed a Republican-backed spending plan. The governor had called for more spending on education and a severance tax on natural gas, while Republicans sought the privatization of state liquor sales and pension changes. A long standoff could affect the timing of state payments to contractors, but Pennsylvania officials said that no immediate shutdown was expected and that state facilities, including parks, would remain open, according to Jeff Sheridan, a spokesman for Mr. Wolf.Yet even states with a single party in control of government have found themselves mired in budget battles this year. In Wisconsin, where Gov. Scott Walker is expected to announce a presidential run in the coming weeks, his fellow Republicans have clashed over the governor's budget proposal and over road construction, financing a new Milwaukee Bucks arena and the state's prevailing wage law, which sets standards for pay on public construction.On Wednesday, legislative leaders announced the framework of a budget deal, which did not include the basketball arena or prevailing wage, both of which will be considered separately. A legislative committee was expected to take up the budget bill later this week. Provisions in Wisconsin allow for government to continue functioning in the new fiscal year before a budget is passed.In South Carolina, Gov. Nikki R. Haley, a Republican, signed a budget but issued dozens of line-item vetoes on Monday. The legislature, dominated by Republicans, is expected to consider overrides next week.And in Kansas, where Republicans control the Capitol, legislators passed a budget bill after a tense session that was the longest in state history. Parts of that agreement were threatened by a court ruling that the method of funding schools was unconstitutional, but that ruling has been stayed by the Kansas Supreme Court.In some states, lawmakers in essence granted themselves extensions, passing resolutions that permit the government to operate temporarily so they can continue hashing out budget disputes beyond the new fiscal year.Massachusetts officials funded the government through July as lawmakers continue to meet in conference committee. In New Hampshire, Gov. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat, vetoed a two-year budget from lawmakers in part because of tax breaks it granted to businesses, but she signed a short-term plan that allows the government to function. And in North Carolina, a continuing resolution will finance government operations through mid-August, giving the House and Senate a chance to resolve a standoff over broad parts of the budget.State Representative Chuck McGrady, a Republican who serves on North Carolina's House Appropriations Committee, said a budget agreement was far from certain, even now, with extra time. 'I wouldn't say I was optimistic,' Mr. McGrady said. 'Is it possible? Yes. Is it possible we'll be coming back and needing more time? Yes.'In Illinois, officials were scrambling to sort out what having no budget will mean. 'We're going to try to manage through this as best we can,' Tim Nuding, Mr. Rauner's budget director, told lawmakers on Tuesday.Democrats pushed an 'essential services' budget'on Wednesday'that would have funded state government for a month, but it failed in the House after clearing the Senate. Lawmakers will be back at the Capitol'next Tuesday.Mr. Rauner and the Democrats, who control the legislature, have battled for months with few signs of progress. He has demanded sweeping change, including an overhaul of workers' compensation rules, term limits for lawmakers and a freeze on property taxes.Democratic leaders have said new revenues were needed to fill a budget deficit of more than $3 billion. Another issue has loomed over budget negotiations here: a significant problem with the financing of government pensions for the state as well as for Chicago and the city's public schools.Chicago Public Schools borrowed money to make a required $634 million payment on Tuesday to a teachers' pension fund. That payment followed a long debate over whether the state might allow a delay and warnings that paying the full cost would affect classroom instruction.Hours after paying the pension fund, the public school system announced $200 million in cuts. Around 1,400 employee positions 'will be impacted beginning Wednesday,' the district said, leading to a rebuke from the teachers' union. Chicago Public Schools has about 41,000 workers.For his part, Mr. Rauner spent part of the day visiting state workers, urging them to keep coming to work while negotiations continue. 'We're going to try to minimize the stress on your families,' he said. 'I want to make darn sure you're paid.'
