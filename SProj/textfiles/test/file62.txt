Standing in front of a hotel emblazoned with Donald J. Trump's name in Las Vegas, Martin O'Malley on Wednesday said that the constant questions about Hillary Rodham Clinton's email use was a distraction for the entire Democratic Party. Mr. O'Malley, a former Maryland governor who is challenging Mrs. Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, suggested the party was becoming defined by the email issue. 'I think it is a huge distraction from what we should be talking about as a party,' Mr. O'Malley said, according to a report by CNN. 'We need to start having debates in the Democratic Party,' he said. 'And we need to have an exchange of ideas of the things we can do to raise wages, to increase the minimum wage, to pay overtime pay for overtime work, to rebuild our country's infrastructure.' 'Until we do, our party's label is going to be the latest news de jour about emails and email servers and what Secretary Clinton knew and when she knew it,' he said. 'What I want to know is what our party has to offer our county to make our economy work and wages go up.'Mr. O'Malley has declined to criticize Mrs. Clinton over her email use, but he has suggested that it is a legitimate issue.But he said the party was making a 'horrible mistake' if the contest was 'defined by the latest questions of the day' that 'Secretary Clinton and her lawyers can only answer.' Mr. O'Malley spoke as a number of Democrats are privately expressing concern about the uncertain nature of the continuing F.B.I. inquiry into Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server while at the State Department. Oil and water, meet de Blasio and Trump.In a clash of political foils on Wednesday, New York City's avowedly liberal mayor, Bill de Blasio, took direct aim at Donald J. Trump, New York City's most avowedly iconoclastic Republican, accusing the developer of 'literally trying to undermine fundamental constitutional rights.'The mayor was referring to Mr. Trump's stance on immigration, but he widened his criticism to take in the developer's disparaging comments about women, Mexican-Americans, and the worthiness of Senator John McCain's war service.'All of these outrageous and inappropriate statements, they will be noted by the American voters,' Mr. de Blasio said in a radio interview on WNYC. 'I just don't think in the end that flies for someone who could actually be president of the United States.''I don't think anyone should take Donald Trump lightly,' Mr. de Blasio added, in a warning to fellow liberals. 'When you take conservatives lightly, you end up getting burned a lot of the time.'So does Mr. de Blasio have a preferred candidate? Prodded to endorse Hillary Rodham Clinton, his former boss, the mayor declined - again - although he conceded that Mrs. Clinton 'has presented an increasingly compelling vision.' This was not Mr. de Blasio's first attack on Mr. Trump: In July, he vowed to review city contracts with Trump-affiliated companies, although City Hall officials later conceded they may not have legal standing to sever ties. 'We're certainly not looking to do any business with him going forward,' the mayor said.Still, the two men have at least one habit in common: They both like to eat pizza with a fork.Common Core is Jeb Bush's Achilles' heel when it comes to courting many conservatives, and on Wednesday the former Florida governor treaded carefully over the subject. Asked about the subject at an education policy forum in New Hampshire, Mr. Bush acknowledged the continuing debate surrounding the set of standards: 'What's that? Common Core?'Mr. Bush has been a backer of Common Core, but as many Republicans detest it as government imposition on schools he has taken an increasingly flexible approach.'If people don't like Common Core, fine,' Mr. Bush said. 'Just make sure your standards are much higher than they were before.'Mr. Bush went on to say that education standards should not be federally driven but that the federal government should partner with states to help improve standards. Recognizing that more government guidance does not necessarily mean greater academic achievement, Mr. Bush said that simpler standards that focus on critical thinking are necessary.However, Mr. Bush did not suggest doing away with testing students.'If you don't measure, you basically don't care,' he said. 'We should make sure there is at least some way of measuring student progress.'If I were, not president, but if I were king in America, I would abolish all teachers' lounges where they sit together and worry how woe is us.'- Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, a Republican presidential candidate, discussing fear-mongering done by teachers' unions at an education forum in New Hampshire. First there was Univision and the beauty queens, then NBC, then the top chefs. Now, in the heart of Clintonland, another one of Donald J. Trump's business interests is under pressure because of his remarks about Mexican immigrants: his Westchester County golf club, which hosts high school proms.  August has become a time for political activism for students at Horace Greeley High School in Chappaqua, N.Y. No strangers to politics - after all, this is the suburb where Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton live - the summer of Trump has crept into summer break.Disgusted by Mr. Trump's assertion that Mexican immigrants are rapists and criminals, a group from the public school has started a push to have their senior prom relocated from his nearby Trump National Golf Club, the white-glove catering place in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. - about seven miles west of Chappaqua - where it has been held for the last several years.'I'm of Hispanic descent, and as soon as I heard him say that all of these immigrants were rapists and drug dealers and all of these horrible things, I just thought this is completely false, this is not true, this is just horrible,' said Julian Robles, 17, a rising senior at the school.Chatting with his friends on Facebook one summer night after several companies began to sever ties with Mr. Trump, Julian proposed starting an online petition to do something about the prom. The group of friends stayed up after midnight developing a case against giving business to Mr. Trump, and more than 90 signatures supporting the cause have emerged on Change.org.The effort has drawn the attention of school administrators and ignited a political debate among some of the youngest potential voters in the 2016 election. Julian said some students who admire Mr. Trump had pushed back against moving the prom, while others think the prom should not be tainted by politics.Unhappy with Mr. Trump's ascendance in Republican presidential primary polls amid what they think is his inflammatory oratory, parents have also joined the discussion with their own petition. For them, protesting the prom has become a way to voice their disapproval of his politics.'Your wallet is the best ballot,' said Barrett Silver, who signed the parent petition urging the prom to be relocated.Officials at Horace Greeley said that they were open to moving the prom, which takes place next spring, but that the decision would ultimately be left to the students, who finance and organize the event.The business losses from moving the 300-person prom is unlikely to sting Mr. Trump, who has absorbed millions of dollars in severed corporate ventures since he started his presidential campaign in June. The billionaire developer, whose campaign declined to comment, has said that offending some people is the cost of running for president.Despite being home to the Clintons, some in Chappaqua appear to be offended by what they see as an unfair attack on Mr. Trump and the injection of presidential politics into a school event.'I think if we start picking venues based on the politics of the owner of a venue, we open a Pandora's box,' one person wrote on a local online forum. 'Where does that end?'Raj Datta, a parent who started the adult petition, said he was surprised by the amount of vitriol he received about the prom in a place where people sometimes run into Mrs. Clinton in the local Starbucks.'Hillary does have some die-hard supporters,' Mr. Datta said. 'But in Chappaqua you couldn't throw a stone without hitting a banker or a lawyer. There's a lot of support for Mr. Trump.'For Julian and some of his school friends, the push to move the prom was more about principle than politics.'We were trying to make sure this debate we're having is less about the actual politics and more about whether a school being associated with someone who says racist things should be allowed,' he said. All those pigs-in-a-blanket can get pricey.Saddled with hundreds of thousands of dollars in catering bills, Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign wants to have donors foot the bill for those appetizers and gin-and-tonics -– not to mention valet parking – at some fund-raisers.She made the unusual request in a letter this month to the Federal Election Commission  asking for its legal blessing to offload the expenses without running afoul of campaign finance limits. The request was first reported by Politico.The worry is that if the donors pick up the tab themselves, the F.E.C. might consider that an 'in-kind contribution' to Mrs. Clinton's campaign that would count against the $2,700 they can each contribute to her campaign in the nominating contest. And that, of course, would leave less cash for the donors to contribute to the campaign.In the request, the campaign wrestled with the distinctly Washington dilemma of how to provide alcohol and nourishment to a roomful of hungry donors.Marc Elias, a lawyer for the Clinton campaign, argued in the letter to the F.E.C. that if Mrs. Clinton holds a fund-raiser at a hotel or a restaurant – but doesn't explicitly promise the guests any food or drinks – the donors should be free to buy it themselves without a legal problem.'Any contrary conclusion here is proven unsound when taken to its logical extreme: if an event  attendee purchases a hot dog at a cart that happens to be set up outside of a campaign event, clearly the payment for the hot dog is not considered an in-kind contribution to the campaign,' Mr. Elias wrote.'The facts presented here are no different. In each case, the campaign has not provided event  attendees with food or beverages, and the attendee has independently made the decision to eat or drink. Further, in each case, that decision has no impact - financial or otherwise - on the campaign.'The F.E.C. had no immediate comment. JERUSALEM – Staking out the most extreme position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the crowded field of Republican candidates – one to the right of even Israel's conservative government – former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas said Wednesday that the entire occupied West Bank was part of Israel, leaving no room for a Palestinian state there. Actually, Mr. Huckabee rejected both the terms 'occupied' and 'West Bank,' repeatedly calling the territory by its biblical name, 'Judea and Samaria,' and said all Americans should visit the area, as he did the day before for a fund-raiser in the Israeli settlement of Shiloh.Other Republican candidates for president, including former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, have criticized the Obama administration for pressing Israel to negotiate a peace deal with the Palestinians. But Mr. Huckabee more clearly disavowed the two-state solution that has been the cornerstone of American foreign policy for years. Though Mr. Huckabee has previously said if Palestinians want a state of their own they should go elsewhere, on Wednesday he ducked the issue of what should become of the 2.5 million Palestinian residents of the West Bank, saying, 'That's a question for the Israelis and the Palestinians to negotiate.'Mr. Huckabee, who is so far gaining less traction than in his 2008 presidential bid, is the latest in a series of Republican hopefuls to make the pilgrimage to Israel. It is, in a way, part of an invisible primary to win the heart – and wallet - of Sheldon Adelson, the megadonor who has questioned the existence of the Palestinian peoplehood. Score one for Mr. Huckabee on terminology. Last year, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey referred to his helicopter ride over the 'occupied territories,' a phrase anathema to Zionist hawks, and ended up apologizing to Mr. Adelson.On Wednesday, before answering a reporter's question about whether the international community was wrong to consider the West Bank illegally occupied, Mr. Huckabee emphatically distanced himself from the terms 'West Bank,' 'illegal' and 'occupied.''Israel has more of a connections to lands in Judea and Samaria – specifically Shiloh, where I was last night, 3,500 years of connections to that very piece of property,' he argued in a news conference at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in Jerusalem. 'In America, we have about a 400-year relationship to Manhattan. It would be as if I came and said, 'We need to end our occupation of Manhattan.' I'm pretty sure most Americans would find that laughable.'Mr. Huckabee, who first visited Israel as a 17-year-old more than four decades ago and has been back dozens of times, also made a security argument for Israeli control of the West Bank. 'I cannot imagine that any American who comes here would somehow feel that the Israelis are out of line in wanting to have as safe a barrier between them and their sworn enemies as possible,' he said, though it was unclear exactly which 'sworn enemies' he was referring to. Jordan, which abuts the West Bank, has had a peace treaty with Israel since 1994.Like Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida before him, Mr. Huckabee got a photo-op and meeting with Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu.'He is a Churchill in a world full of Chamberlains,' Mr. Huckabee posted on Twitter afterward. He told reporters: 'The prime minister in no way by his meeting endorsed me, but I have no problem endorsing him as a true leader in the fight against the Iranian deal.'Mr. Huckabee repeated his vow to repeal the nuclear deal  with Iran if elected, and stood by his comment last month that President Obama's foreign policy 'will take the Israelis and march them to the door of the oven,' a Holocaust reference that many political rivals, American Jews and Israelis denounced as inappropriate.He also inadvertently went back in time when denouncing Iran's plan to buy new defensive weapons 'from the Soviet …' before catching himself and correcting, 'from the Russian government.' Mr. Huckabee deflected a question about the popularity of Donald Trump – 'the one thing I'm not going to do is help Donald Trump get any more publicity' – and said he said he was unconcerned with his low polling numbers.  Noting that those leading in polls in the Republican battles in 2008 and 2012 dropped out before the end of the winter contests, he quoted his campaign manager as advising,  'If you're hot when it's hot, you'll be cold when it's cold.'Good Wednesday morning from Washington. Democrats are quietly counting their Iran votes, and President Obama remains on vacation, hoping things stay as unexciting as possible. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida is getting some attention for his throwing arm, while several other Republicans are heading to New Hampshire to talk education. The Republican presidential contest will shift its debate from immigration to education policy on Wednesday, as several candidates gather in New Hampshire to discuss the future of schools.The news site The Seventy Four, which was created by former television journalist Campbell Brown, will hold a first-of-its-kind public forum featuring about a third of the extensive Republican field: Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Bobby Jindal, Carly Fiorina, Scott Walker and John R. Kasich. The event can be viewed live.Ms. Brown has become an advocate of overhauls to the education system, including changes to the teacher evaluation systems that are part of union contracts. For Mr. Bush, education policy has been a signature issue over the last decade, and the forum gives him a chance to highlight those credentials.But within the Republican contest, education policy has become a fraught topic, particularly around the Common Core education standards. Mr. Bush favors those standards, which many conservative voters oppose.Unlike in a debate format with a 60-second response time, Mr. Bush may have more of an opportunity to explain his views. As for Mr. Christie and Mr. Walker, who both had high-profile fights with the teachers' unions in their respective states, the format will most likely let them showcase their claims to the education battle.- Maggie HabermanStay tuned throughout the day: Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates.Donald J.

There has been no international crisis. No domestic upheaval. No budget standoff. No looming epidemic or storm.For once, Mr. Obama has been free to golf, have long dinners with friends, take walks with his children and hang out at the beach. There have been no briefings by White House officials. There have been no on-camera presidential statements.That's rarely been the case.In 2009, during his first trip to Martha's Vineyard as president, Mr. Obama was forced to skip off the island to deliver a eulogy for Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, who passed away on Aug. 25 that year. Mr. Obama had already interrupted his vacation once that year to reappoint Ben S. Bernanke as the chairman of the Federal Reserve.Last year, the first week of Mr. Obama's vacation was consumed by riots in Ferguson, Mo., and the escalation of fighting against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. Just days after he arrived here in 2014, Mr. Obama confirmed the beheading of James Foley, an American journalist, in a live statement from an elementary school here. The White House later announced that an earlier rescue operation had failed.This time, Mr. Obama is past the halfway mark in his vacation without a crisis. He went to the beach with his family on Tuesday and is likely to watch the island's annual fireworks on Friday.Unless something jinxes things.- Michael D. ShearSenator Robert Menendez on Tuesday delivered a blistering critique of the Iran nuclear deal negotiated by the Obama administration, saying in a speech at Seton Hall University in New Jersey that 'if Iran is to acquire a nuclear bomb, it will not have my name on it.'His position on the agreement was no surprise since Mr. Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, has long since telegraphed his opposition. Neither was his tone since he has clashed harshly with Mr. Obama over foreign policy issues such as Iran and the thaw with Cuba.Mr. Menendez pointedly took issue with the president's characterization of opponents of the deal as the same lawmakers who wrongly supported the war in Iraq, 'I opposed it, unlike the vice president and the secretary of state, who both supported it.'That reference was, of course, to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Secretary of State John Kerry, who both initially backed the Iraq war.Mr. Menendez also disputed the president's claim that the alternative to the agreement was conflict with Iran, and he urged the president to reopen the talks. The question now for the administration is not how Mr. Menendez will vote, but how much he will influence the votes of other Democrats.- Carl HulseMr. Trump has put Republicans in a difficult position by taking such a hard line on immigration.Hillary Rodham Clinton broke ranks with Mr. Obama on the subject of drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic Ocean.Text messaging - an old thing - is proving to be the next big thing in campaign politics this election cycle.In a call with donors, Mr. Walker acknowledged criticisms that he lacked passion in the first debate and said that he would spend more time taking on Washington to counter the rise of outsider candidates like Mr. Trump.Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told The Des Moines Register that there was nothing 'behind the curtain' when it came to Mr. Trump, and he predicted the billionaire's political downfall.Slate looks at the Black Lives Matter movement's focus on Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and asks: 'If Sanders is the most racially progressive candidate in the race,' as his team and supporters say he is, 'then why is he a target for Black Lives Matter activists, even after he addressed core concerns over police violence and criminal justice reform?'Philip Bump at The Washington Post argues that ending birthright citizenship, as Mr. Trump said he would do and as Mr. Walker suggested he wanted to do, would be 'nearly impossible.'Eli Stokols of Politico details Mr. Rubio's slow and steady approach in Iowa.After her strong performance at the 'kiddie table' debate this month, Ms. Fiorina is polling strongly enough to possibly earn a spot on the main debate stage next month, knocking off Mr. Christie, at least according to the latest surveys, Politico reports.Mr. Rubio may have found a way to steal some of the attention that has been lavished on Mr. Trump in recent weeks: hit a child in the face with a football.Mr. Rubio's throw was the talk of Twitter on Tuesday after a video emerged of him tossing spiral to a young Iowan this week. The boy overran the pass, and the ball collided with his nose.The dropped ball unleashed a flurry of commentary about Mr. Rubio's throwing form, and even some suggestions that he send a Hail Mary pass in Mrs. Clinton's direction.The child recovered from the incident, and the Rubio campaign, always happy to make lemonade from a lemon, managed to squeeze a fund-raising opportunity out of it.
