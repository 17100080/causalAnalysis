The Democratic National Committee is moving to drastically beef up its fund-raising arm, adding a finance co-chairman to the current one, who has at times prompted controversy, and announcing six others to leadership positions to help raise money for the 2016 presidential race.Stephen H. Bittel, a real estate developer in Florida who recently hosted Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. at a dinner to benefit the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, will become the new co-chairman of the national finance committee. That job had been held solely by Henry Munoz, a Texas entrepreneur who has come under criticism for being too close to Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign and raising money for it instead of staying neutral.The move by the national committee's chairwoman, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, was seen as an attempt to put new controls on the finance committee, and a reflection of the need to raise large sums as the Republican National Committee has outpaced its fund-raising.The six vice chairmen and chairwomen who were added are Naomi Aberly, another Texan, who raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for President Obama; Ken Solomon, the chief executive of the Tennis Channel; Michele Taylor, a party donor; Dale LeFebvre, an entrepreuner; Patrick Guarasci, owner of G. Strategies; and Lena Kennedy, an Obama donor from Pasadena, Calif.Ms. Wasserman Schultz said in a statement: 'We are thrilled to welcome the new members of our top-notch team. We are building the organization now to make sure that whoever our ultimate nominee is, he or she is in the best possible position to win next November.'The moves come on the heels of the party changing rules to allow the national committee to accept money from lobbyists and PACs. The group entered a joint fund-raising agreement with Mrs. Clinton's campaign, with the money raised being available only for the general election.Mr. Munoz, in a statement, said that the expanded team will put the committee in a better position for beyond 2016, but he added, 'In a tough general election, with what may well end up being unlimited sums of money from the Koch brothers and other self-interested donors, our party needs to do everything we can in this new environment to compete and win.'
