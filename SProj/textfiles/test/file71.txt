First came the grass-roots support. Now Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who has quietly arrived near the front of the Republican presidential field, is scooping up $100,000 a night from wealthy donors in Texas and California - evidence that he is fast transforming from a novelty candidate into one to be taken seriously by rivals and party leaders alike.Trailing only Donald J. Trump in some national surveys, Mr. Carson and Jeb Bush, who is running third in some polls, will flank Mr. Trump at center stage in the second Republican debate at 8 p.m. Wednesday on CNN. With more than $23 million at his disposal, according to his campaign, Mr. Carson has hired a staff of about 75, including 30 field organizers in seven states, seeking to carry him all the way to the Republican National Convention.At the Aug. 6 debate, Mr. Carson went long stretches without speaking, and apparently suffered from stage fright, before finishing with a rousing and funny riff on brain surgery, lamebrains in Washington and 'the torch of freedom.' His minimalist but memorable performance helped uncork about $6.1 million in small donations last month, said Barry Bennett, Mr. Carson's campaign manager. That was twice as much as he had raised in his best previous month.If Mr. Carson has underwhelmed some political analysts, he has captivated ordinary Republican voters, especially religious conservatives. Some 50,000 people paid $25 each for a booklet about his life; $50 donors got a child's name put up on his campaign bus; and his campaign said it had raised $500,000 by selling signed and numbered portraits of him.In all, nearly half a million people have contributed an average of $51 to Mr. Carson - a swell of small-donor support exceeded in either party's race only by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who is crusading against the influence of big money on politics as he seeks the Democratic nomination.Like Mr. Sanders, Mr. Carson is a social-media powerhouse, another sign of grass-roots credibility: He has received almost 2.9 million page likes on Facebook. When he posts answers to supporters' questions at night - 'It had been my goal to conquer the organ in retirement,' he wrote recently - the comments routinely number in the thousands.Unlike Mr. Sanders, though, Mr. Carson has nothing against big money. This month he began a stretch of more than 30 fund-raising events from Bel Air in Los Angeles to South Carolina for donors willing to pay $500 to $2,700, the maximum gift to a candidate allowed by federal law.The events were added to Mr. Carson's schedule after he began surging in the polls, aides said. Earlier, big conservative donors had resisted Mr. Carson, said Doug Watts, a campaign spokesman. 'They said, 'Why don't you prove your street cred first, and then we'll be interested in making large donations,''' Mr. Watts said.Having cleared that bar, Mr. Carson is hitting the private donor circuit in earnest. His goal: $5 million by the end of October.Jennifer Hohman, a co-host of a fund-raising dinner for Mr. Carson in Houston next month, said she was soliciting affluent supporters of social programs for the homeless or for children in foster care, in hopes of raising $250,000. 'This is Bush land,' she said, but added, 'There are a lot of Republican establishment givers who aren't wanting to support the establishment.'One advantage of large donations is that they are less costly to raise. Soliciting small donations, especially by direct mail, can cost nearly as much as the money brought in. It is one reason Mr. Carson burned through 55 percent of the money he reported raising in the first half of the year, one of the fastest rates of any Republican.Another apparent factor in Mr. Carson's high rate of expenditures: his own luxury travel and splurging on musical acts for his campaign events.A rivalry between Mr. Carson and Mr. Trump, both outsiders in a year of strong anti-politician sentiments, could animate this week's debate at the Ronald Reagan Library in Simi Valley, Calif. Mr. Carson has told advisers that he will be more outspoken than in the first debate.On Saturday, Mr. Trump took a jab at Mr. Carson's low-key manner, doubting that he would be aggressive enough as president to represent American interests with foreign competitors. 'I don't think Ben has the energy,' Mr. Trump said.Responding to the criticism Sunday on ABC's 'This Week,' Mr. Carson said, 'It doesn't bother me, because I recognize I have plenty of energy, operating on people for 10, 12, sometimes for greater than 20 hours at a time.' He took his own poke at Mr. Trump: 'You don't have to be loud to be energetic.'Not long ago, Mr. Carson seemed the most far-fetched of candidates. He had compared President Obama's health care law to slavery and was disinvited to speak at Johns Hopkins, his former employer, over comments about gay people. But he has found a legitimacy in his party thanks to his embrace from conservative voters, especially evangelical Christians.'Carson's grass-roots support gives him a staying power that many of the other candidates don't have,' said Erick Erickson, the founder of RedState, an influential conservative blog. But the real tests lie ahead, he cautioned: 'Ultimately, votes are more important than money.'Still, money can keep a candidate in the game a long time, including the support from 'super PACs,' where Mr. Carson has also found success.His first campaign manager, Terry Giles, resigned shortly after Mr. Carson announced his candidacy, and is planning to coordinate the super PACs supporting Mr. Carson, which already say they have raised nearly $20 million. And Mr. Giles just set up a nonprofit to promote Mr. Carson's views using money from donors whose gifts can be unlimited, but whose identities can legally be kept secret.'If you don't have $100 million, you're not going to be competitive in running for president,' said Mr. Giles, a Houston lawyer. 'The process is completely out of control. That's a tragedy, but that's the reality.'One super PAC, the 2016 Committee, has raised $18 million from 148,000 donors, many of them Christian conservatives, said Chuck Muth, a spokesman for the group.Mr. Trump, who boasts of his billions, has financed the bulk of his campaign himself so far, flying in a private helicopter to campaign appearances in Iowa and elsewhere. Mr. Bush, with $103 million in super PAC money behind him, has a significant lead on Mr. Carson in outside financial support.But Carson campaign officials said in interviews that they were unconcerned.'We think we have enough money to compete with anyone, even $100 million super PACs, all the way through the convention,' Mr. Watts, the campaign spokesman, said. 'We're not worried about money at all.'
