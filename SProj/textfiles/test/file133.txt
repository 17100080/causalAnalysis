Republicans increasingly think that Donald J. Trump has the best chance of winning the 2016 presidential election as their nominee as confidence fades in traditional politicians like Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.Although Republicans have reservations about Mr. Trump and voters often end up embracing candidates who lagged in early polls, the billionaire businessman appears to be gaining acceptance as a possible nominee.The poll found that 39 percent of Republican primary and caucus voters viewed Mr. Trump as their best shot at winning the presidency, compared with 26 percent in a CBS survey in August. Only 15 percent said they would not back him as the party's standard-bearer.Ben Carson, another Republican with no history in the political establishment, is also gaining notable new support and is now running nearly even with Mr. Trump. Mr. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon who delivers his socially conservative message and outsider views in more measured tones than Mr. Trump, rose to 23 percent; he had 6 percent early last month before a widely praised performance in the first Republican debate. Mr. Trump draws 27 percent support in the new poll, compared with 24 percent last month.The second Republican debate will be Wednesday evening at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif.Among Democrats, uneasiness with Hillary Rodham Clinton is growing and creating a possible opening for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., as he considers making a late entry to seek the party's nomination. Mrs. Clinton has lost the support of a majority of male Democratic voters and has also had a seven-point drop in support from Democratic women. Her lead over Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has shrunk from 41 percentage points to 20 points. Nearly six in 10 Democrats said they wanted to see Mr. Biden join the race, although it is not unusual for voters to seek additional choices early on.The presidential race at this moment - a personality-driven free-for-all among 16 insiders and outsiders on the Republican side, an endless political therapy session about angst over Mrs. Clinton on the Democratic side - is so unsettled that national polls can be unreliable predictors this far out from voting for party nominees, which begins in February. At this stage eight years ago, Rudolph W. Giuliani and Fred D. Thompson led the Republican field, and Mrs. Clinton held an 18-point lead over then-Senator Barack Obama in a Times/CBS News poll.The current New York Times/CBS News Poll was conducted from Sept. 9 to 13 and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus six percentage points for Republican and Democratic primary voters.The establishment candidates are battling fierce headwinds from a party electorate that vastly prefers a nominee from the business or private sector rather than a traditional politician, by 48 percent to 9 percent. Mr. Bush, a former Florida governor, and Mr. Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, have lost the most support by far since delivering what many analysts called lackluster performances in the August debate. Eleven percent of Republicans viewed Mr. Bush as best positioned to win in the general election, compared with 23 percent in August; only 2 percent thought Mr. Walker was most likely to win, down from 8 percent.Carolyn Dillard, a 55-year-old Republican who is moving from Virginia to Florida, said in a follow-up interview that she was supporting Mr. Trump because he was 'not your typical politician who says everything that is politically correct.' She credited him with targeting the national debt and illegal immigration.'I want somebody who is able to stand tall and say there are serious issues in this country and they need to be addressed,' said Ms. Dillard, a retired teacher and computer specialist. 'We give Iran billions and our bridges are collapsing? Seriously? I'm more interested in leadership experience than political experience.'Republicans showing the greatest political momentum in the poll were the three outsiders: Mr. Trump, who drew strong support from self-described moderates, people with family incomes of $50,000 or less, and those without a college degree; Mr. Carson, who edged out Mr. Trump among conservatives and wealthier voters and was much stronger among college graduates; and Carly Fiorina, a former business executive who had support from 4 percent of Republicans, an improvement over her trace amount in August.'I like Ben Carson because he's not government, and I'm tired of government,' said Doug May, 70, a retired chief information officer in Bluffton, S.C. Mr. May added, referring to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin: 'What worries me the most about Donald Trump is what he would do if put into a situation where he is sitting down with Putin. With his mouth, I have no idea what he would say to people.'Democratic voters seem more enthusiastic about Mrs. Clinton as the party's possible nominee than Republicans do about Mr. Trump. Forty-eight percent of Democrats said they would support her enthusiastically, and 35 percent of Republicans said the same of Mr. Trump.In the face of growing dissatisfaction among voters over all for Mrs. Clinton's explanation about using a personal email server as secretary of state, female Democrats are starting to fall away - and male party members even more so. Thirty-nine percent of male Democrats now support her, down from 53 percent, and 54 percent of Democratic women backed her compared with 61 percent in August. One-quarter of Democratic voters said they were mostly dissatisfied with her explanations on the email issue.While Democrats give Mrs. Clinton high marks for leadership, her rating on honesty and trustworthiness has fallen 10 percentage points from August, to 64 percent. Long the choice of a majority of Democrats, Mrs. Clinton now draws support from 47 percent of them; Mr. Sanders improved his standing by 10 points, to 27 percent.Mr. Biden's theoretical support largely comes from people who would vote for Mrs. Clinton, the poll found; his strongest backers tend to be older and low-income and lack a college education.John Kern, a 28-year-old Democrat from New Jersey who works in financial services, said he believed that Mr. Biden would be the strongest candidate to unify the party and appeal to cross-sections of voters in all regions of the country.'Before Biden, I would have said Clinton, but I'm not really a big supporter of hers anyway,' Mr. Kern said. Referring to the killing of the American ambassador in Libya while Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state, he added, 'It has nothing to do with Benghazi or all the other stuff the Republicans are trying to throw at her. But I think she's been in Washington too long.'But other Democrats were pulling for Mrs. Clinton. Asked their main reasons, they said that she had the right experience and that it was time to have a woman running the country.'I think it would be good to have a woman president, and I like her principles,' said Lyndia Gadsden, 62, a Brooklyn Democrat who works as a lab technologist. 'If Joe Biden wants to run, that's fine, but I still think she's the better candidate.'
