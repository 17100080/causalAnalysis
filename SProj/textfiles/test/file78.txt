A basic fact often gets lost in the propaganda that swirls around voting laws in this country: between one-quarter and one-third of all eligible voters - more than 50 million Americans - are not registered.That alarming statistic is the backdrop to efforts by Republicans in recent years to pass state laws that restrict ballot access, a recent Democratic campaign to push back against those laws, and a bold set of proposals that Hillary Rodham Clinton laid out Thursday afternoon in a speech at Texas Southern University, a historically black college in Houston.In addition to pushing needed and long-overdue reforms, the speech highlighted the yawning gulf on voting rights between Mrs. Clinton and the Republican candidates for the White House, many of whom have been cynically committed to making voting harder for the most vulnerable citizens. 'What part of democracy are they afraid of?' Mrs. Clinton asked.Most significantly, Mrs. Clinton called for universal and automatic voter registration, which would register every American citizen at 18. This would be a transformative step toward modernizing the nation's archaic, error-filled approach to registering voters.No state currently has such inclusive registration, although Oregon came closest in March when it passed a law automatically registering eligible citizens with a driver's license - instantly adding 300,000 voters to the rolls. Since then, 14 states have considered similar proposals to put the burden of registration on the government, where it belongs, and not on individuals.Mrs. Clinton also called for at least 20 days of early voting nationwide, including evenings and weekends. This is a proven way of reducing long lines on Election Day and making voting possible for people whose work or other commitments prevent them from getting to the polls during regular business hours. More than one-third of all votes in the 2012 election were cast early - and yet 14 states still do not offer it, and crucial swing states like Ohio and Florida have actually cut it back.Finally, Mrs. Clinton pushed to repeal punitive state laws that ban people with criminal records from voting, sometimes for life - a population that approaches six million nationwide.These are hardly new issues for the country, and the Republican Party as it now is constituted in Congress is not going to enact the laws to expand voter registration. Still, it is very encouraging to see Mrs. Clinton championing this central democratic principle so early in the campaign. President Obama said very little on voting rights until deep into his second term, even after the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013, freeing up Republican-dominated state governments to enact dozens of new voting restrictions that previously would have been blocked by federal law.Voter ID laws have been a particular favorite, even though their backers know full well that impersonation fraud is essentially nonexistent. In her speech Mrs. Clinton rebuked Republican presidential contenders who have signed such laws - including Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Rick Perry, former governor of Texas. She called on Republicans 'at all levels of government, with all manner of ambition, to stop fear-mongering about a phantom epidemic of election fraud.'Making voting easier for all eligible voters should be the epitome of a nonpartisan issue. Unfortunately, stopping people from voting has become a key part of the modern Republican playbook.The 2016 election will be about many important issues, from income inequality to immigration to health care to education, but at its core it will be a test of two ideas of what it means to be a democracy. One is currently embodied by what Mrs. Clinton called 'a sweeping effort to disempower and disenfranchise people of color, poor people and young people from one end of our country to the other.'The other, as Mrs. Clinton put it, is that, 'We should do everything we can to make it easier for every citizen to vote.'
