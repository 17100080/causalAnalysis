The battle for the Republican presidential nomination has produced an unexpectedly intense burst of attacks on women's reproductive rights, not only on the right to abortion, but also by implication on some of the most commonly used methods of contraception.The shift to an aggressively conservative posture stands in direct contrast to the party's previous five presidential nominees, all of whom sought during their campaigns to play down social issues.In the current Republican presidential contest, 16 candidates have staked out positions against abortion; the exception is George Pataki, former governor of New York, who is pro-choice.More significantly, a majority of the most prominent candidates - Marco Rubio, Scott Walker, Ted Cruz, Ben Carson, Rand Paul and Mike Huckabee, for example - have said at one time or another that they oppose abortion even in the case of rape or incest, a view rejected by all previous party standard-bearers from George H. W. Bush to Mitt Romney.In doing so, these six candidates not only pit themselves against a decisive majority of the electorate, but against a majority of Republican voters.A 2011 Gallup survey found that 59 percent of self-identified anti-abortion Republican-leaning voters agreed that abortion should be legal 'when the pregnancy has been caused by rape or incest.' A 2013 NBC/Wall Street Journal poll revealed that in the country as a whole 10 percent of voters thought that 'abortion should be made illegal without any exceptions.'Equally salient, 15 of the current Republican presidential candidates, including Jeb Bush, Chris Christie and Carly Fiorina, contend that life begins at conception.This stance exposes all 15 to a politically costly debate over contraception, in which they would have to choose between alienating their anti-abortion backers or the estimated six-plus million women using intrauterine devices and the roughly three million women who have taken the morning after pill in the past year following unprotected sexual intercourse. The potential political fallout from a threat to contraception can be seen in the fact that half of the 6.6 million pregnancies in the United States in 2008 were unintended, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which supports reproductive rights.Virtually every major group opposed to abortion takes the position that life begins at fertilization. Any method of contraception that 'may prevent implantation if fertilization does occur,' in this view, amounts to the termination of a human life. Anti-abortion organizations have received support from a number of doctors and researchers who share their belief that life begins at fertilization.Jim Sedlak, vice president of the American Life League, outlined this position in an email responding to my inquiry:By this logic, a presidential candidate seeking to live up to the standards set by Sedlak and others in the anti-abortion community must then agree that the IUD and morning after pill cause abortions.The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists disputes this argument. Instead of addressing the question of when life begins, it maintains in a paper, 'Emergency Contraception and Intrauterine Devices are Not Abortifacients,' that 'pregnancy is established only at the conclusion of implantation of a fertilized egg.' In other words, contraceptive devices that act before implantation do not end a pregnancy because the pregnancy has not begun.The Department of Health and Human Services has a similar definition of pregnancy: 'Pregnancy encompasses the period of time from implantation until delivery.'The Food and Drug Administration has approved 20 contraceptive methods, from male condoms to spermicides. Strict abortion opponents object to four of the 20 - two 'morning after pills,' Plan B and Ella, and two intrauterine devices, ParaGard and Mirena - in the belief that these methods prevent eggs that have been successfully fertilized by sperm from implanting on the wall of the uterus.On March 25, 2014, in the Hobby Lobby decision, the Supreme Court ruled that since 'owners of three closely held for-profit corporations have sincere Christian beliefs that life begins at conception and that it would violate their religion to facilitate access to contraceptive drugs or devices that operate after that point,' these companies may refuse to provide coverage for these four means of contraception.There is disagreement about whether IUDs interfere with the implantation of a fertilized egg. The University of Michigan health care site, designed to provide comprehensive information to college students and faculty, says 'Both types of IUD prevent fertilization of the egg by damaging or killing sperm. The IUD also affects the uterine lining where a fertilized egg would implant and grow,' adding that the copper IUD 'makes the lining a poor place for a fertilized egg to implant and grow.' The Columbia University website addressing the question 'How does an IUD work?' states thatI wrote Kate Connors of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to ask, 'What does ACOG say about the contention of pro-lifers that IUDs can prevent implantation of a fertilized egg?'She replied, 'This is where things get a little murkier. The copper IUD may prevent implantation of a fertilized egg, although this is rare. Generally, it works by killing and blocking the sperm.'Even if the copper IUD prevents implantation, Connors added, 'based on the law and on medical science, this is not a pregnancy. IUDs do not disrupt if it is implanted.'Extensive research has found the IUD to be highly reliable and safe, and, as a result the number of women using IUDs is rising at a rapid pace.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, among women between 15 and 44 usage of the IUD grew from less than 1 percent in 1995 to 6.4 percent in 2011-13. The Kaiser Family Foundation reported even higher usage, 10.7 percent, in 2011-13, when the number of women in this age group reached an estimated 62 million.When I asked some of the prominent Republican candidates to detail their positions on contraception, they were reluctant to get into specifics. I sent an email with these basic questions to the candidates:Kristy Campbell, spokeswoman for Jeb Bush, wrote: 'Yes on supporting exceptions for life of the mother, rape and incest. He supports the 20-week Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.' As governor of Florida, she wrote,AshLee Strong, spokeswoman for Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, responded to my inquiry with: 'The governor is 100 percent pro-life. He acknowledges what science says, and that is that an unborn child is that - a child, and deserving of protection.'Rick Tyler, spokesman for Ted Cruz, senator from Texas, replied without elaboration: 'Life at conception, no exceptions.'Anna Epstein, spokeswoman for Carly Fiorina, sent a link to a video of a Jan. 15, 2015, speech Fiorina gave at the Heritage Foundation in which the candidate did not address the specific question I asked.Alex Conant, communications director for Senator Marco Rubio, and Chris Schrimpf, spokesman for John Kasich, governor of Ohio, did not respond to repeated inquiries.In public statements, Rubio and Ben Carson have attempted to have it both ways. The two declare that they believe life begins at conception. At the same time, Rubio and Carson have endorsed the use of IUDs and the morning after pill despite the view prevalent in the anti-abortion community that these contraceptive devices are abortifacients.It will be interesting to track their responses when challenged by social conservatives as the campaign progresses.Even more interesting will be tracking the voting intentions of women as Nov. 8, 2016, approaches. In 2012, Mitt Romney won among men, 52-45, but lost the election because women, 53 percent of voters that year, backed Obama 55-44. Romney carried married women by a relatively modest 7 points, 53-46, but he got crushed among single women, 67-31.To win the presidency, Republicans clearly need to improve their numbers among women, but their approach on reproductive issues appears likely to make that goal difficult.Further compounding the hurdles facing Republicans are the party's current drive to defund Planned Parenthood, and the sustained effort to reduce the number of abortion clinics in Republican-controlled states.This effort includes legislation effectively closing such clinics by requiring, in the case of Texas, that 'a physician performing or inducing an abortion must, on the date the abortion is performed, have active admitting privileges at a hospital that is located not further than 30 miles from the location at which the abortion is performed,' and that abortion facilities must meet the 'minimum standards for ambulatory surgical centers'; requiring women to undergo sometimes invasive ultrasound procedures before being allowed to have an abortion; and imposing restrictions on abortion coverage in private health insurance plans.The conflicts over reproductive rights within both the Republican Party and within the social conservative movement are inevitable. They result from the fact that the ideological purity - the moral absolutism - of the anti-abortion movement conflicts with the far more complex views and the pragmatism of the electorate, including many conservative Republicans.For decades, the Republican Party found political success fighting a rear-guard action against the sexual and feminist revolutions. What remains to be seen is whether the flare-up of pronounced anti-abortion stands and objections to key forms of contraception represent a deepening determination on the right to fight to the bitter end or whether they are more like the burst of flame in a match just as it is about to go out.
