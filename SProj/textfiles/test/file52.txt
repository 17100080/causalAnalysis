WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. -  A federal trial that may help shape voting rights protections across the country in the 2016 elections and beyond came to a close here Friday, with the Department of Justice and civil rights groups charging that North Carolina deliberately sought to suppress black voting with a new election law, while the state defended its right to set election rules and said it treated all races equally.'African-Americans were on the verge of having real influence in the state of North Carolina,' Bert Russ, a lawyer with the Justice Department, said of the expanded voting procedures that were curtailed in a Republican-sponsored 2013 law. 'The legislature stepped in and took away' the methods that drove this progress, he said, in 'a troubling mixture of race and politics.'But a lawyer for the state argued that North Carolina had the right to set its election policies, and that the black voter turnout in 2014, under the new rules, was actually higher than before. The lawyer, Thomas A. Farr, accused the plaintiffs of trying to protect 'practices that their political allies prefer.'Summing up three weeks of testimony, the Justice Department and civil rights groups charged that North Carolina legislators, to gain partisan advantage, trimmed back voting methods like extended early voting and same-day registration that were most heavily used by African-Americans. Blacks in the state overwhelmingly tend to vote Democratic.The trial may set an important precedent. The Justice Department asked the judge, Thomas D. Schroeder of Federal District Court, who is hearing the case with no jury, not only to block the 2013 law, but also to reinstate strong federal oversight of election practices in North Carolina.That oversight came to an end in 2013, when the Supreme Court effectively struck down a crucial provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which required federal approval of election changes in states with histories of discrimination, including North Carolina. Since then, the reach of federal voting protections has been unclear, and several states have tightened voter ID requirements or reduced voting opportunities in ways that critics said would curb voting by members of minority groups and the poor.'This is a key test case under the Voting Rights Act and the Constitution,' said Richard L. Hasen, a voting rights expert at the University of California, Irvine, School of Law. 'If North Carolina is able to roll back rules to ease registration and voting, for reasons which seem little more than an attempt to secure partisan advantage, then expect other states with Republican governments to follow.'In the case here, and two in Texas involving redistricting and a voter ID law, civil rights advocates hope the courts will give strong legal teeth to a surviving section of the Voting Rights Act. That provision bans measures that result 'in a denial or abridgment' of voting rights based on race - but what that means in practice is not well defined.While there is wide interest in the trial in legal circles, perhaps no one followed it more closely than Mary E. Perry, an 85-year-old African-American woman from Wendell, N.C., and a local N.A.A.C.P. leader who attended from start to finish. Recalling a lifetime of civil rights struggles, she said in an interview that she was here because 'they want to take away what we fought so hard to achieve.'North Carolina's legislature altered or eliminated voting methods that had been adopted over the previous 15 years to increase participation by minority voters and draw more young people into voting.In addition to ending the ability to register and vote on the same day, the North Carolina law reduced early voting to 10 days from 17, cutting out one of the 'souls to the polls' Sundays in which black churches sent members to vote. It also ended the possibility of voting outside one's precinct and ended the preregistration of 16- and 17-year-olds.For a variety of social and historical reasons, the measures had been disproportionately used by African-Americans. And they were having the intended effect.The share of registered voters in the state who were black climbed to 22.5 percent in 2014, from 19.4 percent in 2004, according to testimony by Allan J. Lichtman, a professor of political history at American University, achieving parity with the black share of the overall population.Over the same period, the white share of registered voters fell, to 71 percent in 2014, from 77.9 percent in 2004. Together, these trends resulted in a 10 percent swing in voting power, Mr. Lichtman testified.But Mr. Farr, a private lawyer hired by the state for this case, said there was no proof that the curtailed election practices were responsible for the rise in black registration, which he said may have been partly driven by excitement over the candidacy of Barack Obama.It was no coincidence, the plaintiffs argued, that the legislature adopted the sweeping law only weeks after the Supreme Court decision, Shelby County v. Holder, which ended federal oversight.Freed of that oversight, the legislature, giving vague reasons of efficiency and protecting electoral integrity, immediately rolled out what experts said was the broadest range of cutbacks seen in any state in recent years. The law also included a stringent voter ID requirement that has since been softened and was not included in the current trial.The 'cumulative impact' of all these changes at once imposed a burden on minority voters that is illegal under the Voting Rights Act and also the 14th and 15th Amendments, said Daniel T. Donovan, a lawyer with Kirkland and Ellis who was arguing on behalf of the North Carolina N.A.A.C.P.But an expert testifying for the state, Trey Hood, a political scientist at the University of Georgia, said he could find no evidence that the altered rules hampered black voting in 2014.The plaintiffs offered numerous anecdotal accounts by minority voters who missed the chance to register or vote under the new rules. Their experts said that intense voter drives, plus an unusually heated Senate race, helped explain why the black turnout was nevertheless higher than in the previous midterm election, in 2010.The plaintiffs also argued that the discriminatory impact was intentional and were asking Judge Schroeder to reimpose federal oversight of voting law changes here and in Texas, which legal experts say will be hard to achieve even if the contested laws are overturned. The legislators who sponsored the 2013 law have refused to testify, citing legislative immunity.During closing arguments Friday, Judge Schroeder, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, peppered the plaintiffs' lawyers with questions about why the repeal of extra voting opportunities that do not exist in many states would be illegal.But he also pressed the state's lawyers on what motivated legislators to make the sudden changes to a system that seemed to be popular and working well. 'They made voting easier and that's a good thing,' he said of the measures that were trimmed or repealed.His ruling is not expected for many weeks and is almost certain to be appealed, perhaps as far as the Supreme Court.
