COLUMBUS, Ohio -  As the people of Ohio already know - and Republican voters elsewhere are just beginning to find out - Gov. John R. Kasich grew up in working-class McKees Rocks, Pa., the son of a postal worker and the grandson of a coal miner. His grandfather was so poor, Mr. Kasich recently told voters in New Hampshire, that he would bring home scraps of his lunch to share with his children.'They would even be able to taste the coal mine in that lunch,' Mr. Kasich said. 'Some of you can relate to that.'As a congressman and as governor, Mr. Kasich has made hardscrabble stories of life in McKees Rocks a cornerstone of his political biography. And now the story of his blue-collar roots is an important part of how he is trying to distinguish himself in a crowded presidential primary field and draw a contrast with two of his leading competitors, Donald J. Trump and Jeb Bush, who grew up in wealthy families.But there is a chapter in Mr. Kasich's life story that conflicts with this narrative: the nearly eight years he spent as an investment banker with Lehman Brothers, the Wall Street firm. Mr. Kasich's career at Lehman, neatly tucked between his time as a congressman and his election as governor, coincided with the bank's messy collapse in September 2008, a downfall that helped throw the American economy into free fall.Matthew Dowd, the former chief strategist for President George W. Bush's 2004 re-election campaign, who today considers himself an independent, says Mr. Kasich has the potential to emerge as a favorite of establishment Republicans - and a credible general election threat to Democrats, including Hillary Rodham Clinton - but only if he distances himself from Wall Street.'The base of the Republican Party right now is blue-collar, frustrated white males,' Mr. Dowd said, 'and that group is angry at big government and angry at Wall Street.'Far from treating his time at Lehman as a liability, however, Mr. Kasich has embraced it since announcing his candidacy last month, making it part of the image he seeks to project of a common-sense Midwesterner who can empathize with economic anxieties and has the business experience to allay them.'I want to talk about it,' he told voters recently. 'Because I actually understand how job creators make decisions, and that's really, really critical if you want to be involved in economic growth.'That explanation worked well for Mr. Kasich during his campaign for governor in 2010, when memories of the financial crisis in this recession-battered state were still painfully fresh.Democrats saw his Wall Street ties as a weakness, but Mr. Kasich managed to turn a potential vulnerability into a strength, beating the incumbent Democrat, Ted Strickland, by pledging to make Ohio's government 'move at the speed of business.'Mr. Kasich, who with his wife has assets worth between $9 million and $22 million, according to a recent financial disclosure, is hardly the only 2016 Republican hopeful with business ties. Mr. Trump has flaunted his success and wealth, and Mr. Bush advised Lehman, earning $1.3 million a year for two years from the firm. Mr. Kasich, whose 2008 tax return showed roughly $600,000 in salary and bonus from Lehman, recalls that their paths crossed there once, during a meeting with an industrial client in Wisconsin.But for Mr. Kasich, business was more a second career after a long string of successes in politics. He left Congress in January 2001 after an 18-year career that included a role as one of Newt Gingrich's lieutenants when he was House speaker, a stint as House Budget Committee chairman and a failed bid for the Republican presidential nomination.A friend helped him land an interview at Lehman Brothers.'I came away thinking: interesting guy, not like a major door-opener,' recalled Gary Weinstein, who interviewed him and became his boss. As to what the congressman knew about banking, Mr. Weinstein said, 'Zero. It was shocking to me.'Working in Columbus out of a two-man office, Mr. Kasich struggled at first to gain acceptance from New York bankers who seemed to have little use for him. 'They didn't welcome him into the club,' said Wilber James, the friend who helped arrange the interview.But Mr. Kasich could still open some doors. He took bankers to California to meet Sheryl Sandberg, then a Google executive and a former Treasury Department official, which led to a small role for Lehman in Google's 2004 public stock offering.Here in Ohio, Mr. Kasich got Lehman involved in the public offering for Designer Shoe Warehouse, or DSW, a Columbus-based shoe retailer founded by the Schottenstein family, which employed Mr. Kasich after Lehman's demise.Mr. Kasich also made introductions for Lehman to Ohio state pension funds, which drew the ire of Democrats after the funds lost hundreds of millions of dollars in ill-fated investments with the bank. Mr. Kasich has said his contacts did not result in any business for Lehman.But friends say Mr. Kasich was most captivated - and perhaps influenced - by his work in Silicon Valley, where he had grown close to Mark Kvamme, a venture capitalist. 'You're from Silicon Valley. Are you rich?' Mr. Kvamme recalls the blunt Mr. Kasich asking when they first met.Mr. Kvamme made introductions to other venture capitalists and tech entrepreneurs, and over time, Mr. Kasich and his longtime aide, Jai Chabria, the other half of the two-man Lehman operation in Columbus, eventually managed relationships with 45 companies.Then, in 2008, Lehman collapsed, a victim of its own risky mortgage investments, which Mr. Kasich said did not involve him. 'I was a banker,' he said. 'I wasn't offering home loans to anybody.'Like other Lehman employees who held stock options, Mr. Kasich lost money when the firm collapsed. He also said he was 'diversified,' with income from his work as a Fox News analyst, corporate boards and public speaking. What he gained, he said, was an understanding 'of the way C.E.O.s think.'As governor, Mr. Kasich quickly put that understanding to use - and drew criticism from Democrats who said that he brought a Wall Street mentality to the job. With varying degrees of success, he pushed a series of economic initiatives, including a proposal to sell state prisons and use the Ohio Turnpike to issue bonds.But perhaps his most contentious decision was to dismantle the state's economic development agency and replace it with a private entity, JobsOhio, and put Mr. Kvamme in charge. Critics say the governor positioned his friend to benefit - an accusation Mr. Kvamme, who earned just $1 a year to run JobsOhio and now runs a venture capital firm, dismisses as 'silly.'As JobsOhio offered tax incentives and other inducements to lure companies to relocate or expand in Ohio, Democrats and advocates for openness in government complained it was cutting deals in secret. David Yost, the state auditor and a Republican, called for greater transparency in the agency's activities, though Mr. Kasich insisted that JobsOhio was 'very transparent.'But, said David Pepper, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, 'his mind-set was, 'I'm just going to do what a business does, and if that means not sharing information, that's fine - if that means hiring buddies, that's fine too.'''Today, as Mr. Kasich's campaign seems to be gaining some traction in the early primary state of New Hampshire, Democrats - especially here in Ohio - are working hard to remind voters of his Lehman past. When Mr. Kasich vowed to reform Social Security by giving younger Americans 'an opportunity to earn money through the strength of our American economy,' the Ohio Democratic Party accused him of trying to hand 'Social Security funds over to the same Wall Street banks that caused the Great Recession - and coincidentally turned Kasich into a millionaire.'Mr. Kasich shrugs it off. His strategy is, as it has always been, to strike an aw-shucks tone, and invoke roots in McKees Rocks.'I made more money than I ever thought I would make in something like that, and I'm thankful for my experience,' he said of his time at Lehman, expressing astonishment that 'little Johnny Kasich' had come so far. 'I don't know how much you've looked at McKees Rocks, but it's been an amazing journey.'
