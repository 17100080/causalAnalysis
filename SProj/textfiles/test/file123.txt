WASHINGTON -  Of the many offenses Senator John McCain has committed in the eyes of his most ardent conservative critics - supporting an immigration overhaul, for example, or more recently calling some of them 'crazies' - a poor record on veterans' issues is not one that has ever come up.That left Donald J. Trump with few defenders after the attacks he leveled at Mr. McCain over the weekend, and facing a barrage of condemnation himself on Monday over his own commitment to veterans' causes as well as the propriety of attacking a former prisoner of war who is honored as a hero.Mr. Trump, a businessman who is running an outsider's campaign for the Republican nomination for president, first said that Mr. McCain was 'not a war hero' because he was captured after bailing out of his Navy jet during the Vietnam War. Then he said that as a senator Mr. McCain had failed to lead on military and veterans' issues, while he has championed their cause.Mr. Trump did soften his words somewhat late on Monday when he told Bill O'Reilly of Fox News that he has respect for Mr. McCain and said, 'Certainly if there was a misunderstanding, I would totally take that back.'But veterans' groups said Mr. Trump was in no position to criticize anyone, and denied that he is the longtime ally he claims to be.'Donald Trump is not a leader in veterans' philanthropy, unless he's donated a lot of money that nobody knows about,' said Paul Rieckhoff, founder and chief executive of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. 'We were founded in New York. We are headquartered in New York. I've been here 10 years, and I don't think I've ever even seen Donald Trump.'Mr. Trump's attacks were all the more misguided, veterans' advocates said, because Mr. McCain has an extensive record of being helpful and involved. He has played a leading role in passing numerous pieces of legislation that aim to improve veterans' health care.In just the last year, Mr. McCain was a key player in negotiations with Senator Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who was then chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, to pass a broad-based overhaul of the Department of Veterans Affairs after the disclosure that staff members had been manipulating wait times to make it appear that patients were receiving care faster than they were.Mr. McCain was also a lead sponsor of the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act - one of the first pieces of legislation that became law after Republicans took over Congress this year.Mr. McCain's office said Monday that it was currently processing 600 veterans-related cases and had dedicated five of its 10 case workers to working on Veterans Affairs complaints full time.For his part, Mr. McCain, who is now chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, demurred on Monday when asked if Mr. Trump should apologize to him. Rather, he said, Mr. Trump should apologize to the men and women who have been captured in war and whose service Mr. Trump appeared to belittle.'I think he may owe an apology to the families and those that have sacrificed in conflict and those who have undergone the prison experience in serving their country,' a reserved Mr. McCain said in his first comments on the matter on the MSNBC program 'Morning Joe.''There are so many men and some women who have served and sacrificed who happened to have been held prisoner - to denigrate that service I think is offensive to most of our veterans,' Mr. McCain added.Mr. McCain's friend Senator Lindsey Graham, who is also seeking the Republican presidential nomination, was more direct. 'To anybody who suggests that John and his fellow P.O.W.s are somehow lacking in the title of being called American hero, you shouldn't be our commander in chief because you don't know our military,' he said without mentioning Mr. Trump's name.Why Mr. Trump would single out veterans' issues and Vietnam as a line of attack - when his own record on the subject is not extensively documented, and he avoided serving in Vietnam by receiving a medical deferment - is unclear. Mr. Trump and his campaign advisers have pointed to a few examples of Mr. Trump's advocacy decades ago, including his donation of over $1 million to build a Vietnam veterans memorial in New York in the 1980s and his underwriting of a parade honoring veterans in 1995.Writing in USA Today, Mr. Trump said on Monday, 'It was one of the biggest parades in the history of New York City, and I was very proud to have made it possible.'His campaign also noted that he had put on various benefits for organizations like the Wounded Warriors Project and had hosted active-duty soldiers and veterans at his golf courses.But a review of publicly available records of Mr. Trump's charitable contributions shows that relatively little of his money has gone to programs that support veterans. While he has donated millions of dollars to charities like the United Way and the American Heart Association, records show that he gave at least $20,000 and possibly as much as $50,000 to the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund in 2003 and 2004. He donated in later years for unspecified amounts.Even some of Mr. Trump's allies said that they would not quibble with Mr. McCain's record. 'Don't get me wrong, I think John McCain is strong on veterans' issues,' said Joel Arends, chairman of Veterans for a Strong America, which defended Mr. Trump over the weekend in a statement that his campaign issued in a news release.'The problem is not John McCain's record. The problem is how do we run government and is government going to be responsive to men and women who've laid their lives on the line for this country,' Mr. Arends said, adding that he believed Mr. Trump had hit a nerve by identifying the inefficiencies and breakdowns in veterans' services.Some advocates said they were hoping that the glare of media attention that Mr. Trump has turned on them would be of benefit. 'I've gotten more media calls today than I probably have in the last 11 years,' Mr. Rieckhoff said. 'But this is a bigger conversation than whether or not Trump said something stupid.'
