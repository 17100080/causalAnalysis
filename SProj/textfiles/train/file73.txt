Over the last few weeks, a number of Republican presidential candidates have begun to criticize President Obama and the Black Lives Matter protest movement, saying they are encouraging crime. Although there's little evidence of a crime wave outside of a few major cities where homicides have increased, the political rationale seems obvious: The candidates are playing to the G.O.P. base, a normal part of the primary season.Another possibility, though, is that Republicans are also still searching for the best angle of attack against Hillary Rodham Clinton and the Democrats, who remain narrow betting market favorites in 2016. Despite recent economic turbulence, the Democrats' main advantage at this point is a generally positive economic outlook for next year, which requires Republicans to look for other issues they can wield against the incumbent party.Recently, G.O.P. candidates have been linking recent crime to protests against police misconduct and even President Obama's public statements on the issue. Donald Trump, for instance, alleged that police officers in Baltimore 'allowed that city to be destroyed' after protests there, and also called for 'law and order' and strengthened police powers in response to a 'crime wave.' Similarly, Ted Cruz and Scott Walker responded to the murder of a sheriff's deputy in Texas with statements blaming Mr. Obama for increased anti-police language, which they suggested endangers public safety and law enforcement.Some G.O.P. strategists fear that these tactics could be damaging in the general election, but the party's turn toward a hard-edged message on crime can be interpreted as an attempt to find a noneconomic issue it can use against Democrats. When parties can't run on the state of the economy, Lynn Vavreck, a political scientist and an Upshot contributor, has argued, they have to emphasize an alternative issue where they have an inherent advantage and the other party can't easily change position. Could crime be that issue for the G.O.P.?Crime rates are down substantially from historical highs, and it currently ranks very low on the list of the problems the public considers most important. However, crime was previously a highly salient issue that the public perceived Republicans as better able to handle. Moreover, Democrats are committed to criminal justice reform, leaving them vulnerable to crticism if a nascent bipartisan consensus on the issue falls apart and if protests or reforms are perceived as encouraging crime, including violence against the police.These Republican attacks could also be politically damaging to Democrats because of the unavoidable racial connotations. The United States has a long history of politicians who play to the fears of white voters with claims of threats to public safety from crime and protest movements including, most recently, Mr. Trump, who asserted a dubious link between illegal immigration from Mexico and violent crime. Such fears are likely to be strengthened if Republicans invoke Mr. Obama, whose very identity, studies show, can further polarize Americans along racial lines.In this sense, the current debate over crime is not only a threat to the effort to push criminal justice overhaul legislation through Congress but a preview of a possible G.O.P. general election strategy.
