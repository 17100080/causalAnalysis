AS brothers who governed large states at the same time, each Bush was bound to be defined in terms of the other. George was the impulsive one who'd stumbled and then swaggered toward success. Jeb was the cogitator, the toiler. George was the extrovert: He worked the room. Jeb was the introvert: He read the books.That was how they were discussed back in 1999 and 2000, and the word on their ideological differences was that George was perhaps a bit more moderate, while Jeb was the truer conservative.What a difference a decade and a half make. How the sands of politics shift.As Jeb Bush seemingly leans toward a presidential run, many observers are casting him as a centrist. And there are indeed elements of his current message that suggest that if he won 'the nomination as well as the presidency, it could reshape Republican politics for a generation,' as Jonathan Martin wrote in The Times late last week. But Martin noted other elements of Bush's message and record as well, the ones that explain why a separate camp of observers look at him and see someone else. For instance, in Politico Magazine, the journalist S. V. DÃ¡te observed that for him and others 'who covered Jeb's two terms in Tallahassee,' characterizations of Bush as a moderate are 'mind-boggling.'Just what kind of Republican is Jeb Bush?  That question is being asked with increasing frequency. And the absence of a clear answer, coupled with the insistence on one, is instructive.It speaks to the fact that most successful politicians aren't fixed in one place forevermore. They're the products of certain unwavering convictions and certain adaptations to circumstance, and the measures of each are different at different moments in their careers.The futile tussle to define Bush also reflects the way ideological yardsticks change over time. Above all else, it exposes the poverty of our political vocabulary.Left, center, right. Liberal, moderate, conservative. We reach fast for these labels and itch to put pols in these boxes, no matter how untidy or impermanent the fit. Some of the expected candidates for 2016 are great examples.Hillary Clinton: liberal or moderate? Depends on which point in her past you choose. Toward the beginning of Bill's successful 1992 quest for the presidency, she was part of his decision to steer away from the left, as The Times's Peter Baker and Amy Chozick recently reported. They noted that in the recollection of Al From, the founder of the Democratic Leadership Council, Hillary pledged, 'We're going to be a different kind of Democrat by the convention.'But there were chapters after Bill's election when she came across as a familiar kind of Democrat, and then there's the present, when she's seen as someone so estranged from some traditional Democratic principles that there's a movement to draft Elizabeth Warren to challenge her. It apparently gathered steam last week, just as Clinton topped a CNBC poll of 500 millionaires who were asked about their preference for president in 2016. She got 31 percent of the vote, while Bush was second with 18. I await a new 'super PAC,' Mills for Hills.The Republican field is almost always broken down into candidates of the right and those of the center: a schematic to which we journalists cling. It's hugely flawed this time around. Rand Paul evades it so completely that he gets his own adjective - libertarian - even though some of his positions on social issues contradict it.Chris Christie gets the moderate box, because he was twice elected governor of a blue state; signed legislation granting in-state tuition to undocumented immigrants in New Jersey; pushed criminal-justice reforms that stress rehabilitation; outlawed therapy that aims to turn gay teenagers straight; and accepted the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare. And right after Hurricane Sandy, he and President Obama had their soggy, windswept bromance.But Christie also opposes same-sex marriage and abortion rights. He has vetoed some sensible gun-control legislation. And he sidesteps questions about immigration reform. He's not exactly a paragon of moderation.Marco Rubio, another possible presidential contender, isn't easily labeled either. Back in 2010, when he won election to the Senate, he was presented as a mascot of the right, a Tea Party darling. But he has endorsed a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. And his proposals for making college more affordable and student loans less onerous aren't just bold. They're progressive.BUSH'S categorization as a moderate owes much to the passion he brings to the issues of immigration and education and his dissent from hard-line conservatives on both. These rebellions are meaningful.So was his commentary from the sidelines of the 2012 presidential race. After a Republican primary debate in which all eight candidates said that they would refuse a budget deal that included $10 of reduced spending for every $1 in tax increases, he made clear that he didn't agree with the pack. And he said that his party had drifted rightward enough that someone like Ronald Reagan would have difficulty finding a receptive home in it.That assessment suggested one reason Bush is now deemed a centrist: The poles have moved.But much of his record in Florida is that of the 'headbanging conservative' he claimed to be during a first, unsuccessful campaign for governor in 1994. He won the next time, in 1998. He slashed taxes. He was a friend to gun owners: Florida's 'Stand Your Ground' law was enacted on his watch.In the case of Terri Schiavo, a Florida woman deemed by many physicians to be in a persistent vegetative state, he intervened on the side of her parents - but against the wishes of her husband, who was her legal guardian - to prevent the removal of a feeding tube. And he was an assertive opponent of abortion rights. He still opposes them, and same-sex marriage.But he learned between his 1994 defeat and 1998 victory to reach out to minorities and speak inclusively and hopefully. When he recently told an audience in Washington that a person had to be willing to lose the Republican primary to win the general election, he was in part alluding to that lesson, and he was telegraphing the tone that a Bush campaign would take. He was also signaling a suspicion of labels and boxes.We should be similarly wary of them, because we've routinely seen leaders defy our assumptions. Jeb's brother George, for example, campaigned for the presidency as someone cautious about overextending the American military and adamant about fiscal restraint. And while we took him for an inveterate backslapper, he now spends much of his time alone at an easel.That's how it goes with so many politicians. We think we've figured them out, but we're hasty and they're slippery.
