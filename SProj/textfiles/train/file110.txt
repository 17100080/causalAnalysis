WASHINGTON - The $4 trillion budget that President Obama released Monday is more utopian vision than pragmatic blueprint for his final years in office, but buried in the document are kernels of proposals that could take root even with a hostile Republican Congress.In his penultimate budget, Mr. Obama proclaimed victory in the long climb from deep recession and said the time had come to loosen the strictures of austerity to invest in the nation's future, laying out a plan likely to shape the 2016 presidential contests. He relies on large tax increases, on corporations and the wealthy, to finance efforts in education, infrastructure construction and work force development that he says have waited far too long.'I want to work with Congress to replace mindless austerity with smart investments that strengthen America,' the president declared on a visit to the Department of Homeland Security. He said he would not accept spending bills that maintained tough budget caps he agreed to in 2011, nor would he loosen budget controls on military spending without relaxing them for domestic programs.But hidden in some of his most ambitious proposals to diminish the wealth gap and remake the corporate tax code are areas of potential compromise that nod to Republican ideas: an expansion of the earned income credit for the working poor, a revitalized Pentagon budget, and a surge in spending on roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure, financed by a new tax rate on foreign corporate profits.Absent from the plan is any pretense of remaking the main drivers of the long-term debt - Social Security and Medicare - a quest that has long eluded both parties. In all, such entitlement programs would go from consuming 13.2 percent of the economy this year to 14.8 percent in a decade, while domestic and military programs under Congress's discretion would shrink to 4.5 percent of the economy in 2025, from the current 6.4 percent.'It's a visionary document and basically says, 'You're with me or you're not,' and we can have big philosophical arguments about the role of government, and perhaps in 2016 we will,' said Jared Bernstein, a former top economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. 'The other way to look at it is, it's a Chinese menu, and you're not going to share the duck, but you might split the egg rolls.'The document is undergirded by two major presidential initiatives that have virtually no chance in Congress: large tax increases on multinational corporations and the rich, and a comprehensive immigration law that would lift the economy with millions of newly legalized, taxpaying workers.The proceeds of those initiatives would pay for free community college, more generous child care subsidies and education tax credits, paid sick leave, expanded unemployment benefits, and tax credits for two-earner middle-class couples, among other offerings.The White House even did away with the usual plain blue budget document cover for a gritty black-and-white photo of the Tappan Zee Bridge in New York, making vivid the president's emphasis on 'a 21st-century infrastructure that creates jobs for thousands of construction workers and engineers, connects hard-working Americans to their jobs, and makes it easier for businesses to transport goods,' as Mr. Obama wrote in the opening budget message.The push reflects the degree to which Mr. Obama emerged from last year's midterm election losses determined to reinforce - rather than scale back - his belief that the government should play a fundamental role in spreading economic prosperity.'As we move forward with the legislative battles of the next two years and then the presidential election, the dominant question in the country will be who has better ideas to address the country's economic needs,' said Geoff Garin, who conducts polling for Democrats. 'Democrats were criticized in the last campaign for not running on a positive economic vision, and the president's budget this year does lay out that vision.'Yet it was a vision that Republicans quickly made clear they did not share. 'The president says he wants to work with Congress, but everything he does indicates the opposite,' said Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California, the House majority leader. 'His latest budget simply isn't a serious proposal.'But Mr. Obama does have pressure points to force Republicans to the negotiating table. Republican defense hawks like Senator John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, want to free the military of automatic spending caps, known as sequestration, something Mr. Obama will not accept without relief for domestic programs as well.'I'm not going to accept a budget that locks in sequestration going forward,' Mr. Obama said Monday. 'It would be bad for our security and bad for our growth. I will not accept a budget that severs the vital link between our national security and our economic security.'At the end of May, the highway trust fund will again be depleted, and Mr. Obama is embracing a proposal not too different from one put forward by Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky: Offer businesses a one-time low corporate tax rate on overseas profits they would have to bring home, and use the proceeds for infrastructure construction.The president wants to spend $478 billion on transportation and infrastructure over six years, more than one-third more than the current spending rate and a 75 percent increase for mass transit. Roughly half that money would come from the current taxes on gasoline and other fuels. An additional $238 billion would come from the one-time surge of taxes as corporations are forced to pay 14 percent on profits now parked abroad.The White House wants that proposal to be part of a much larger plan to change the way businesses are taxed and lower the corporate tax rate to 28 percent - 25 percent for manufacturers - from 35 percent.But with the clock ticking on federal highway and transit programs, that more ambitious plan could fall away for a targeted infrastructure plan backed by both parties.Mr. Obama also proposed a major expansion of the earned income credit for low-income workers without children. That is a plan also backed by leading Republicans such as Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. But paying for it would be difficult. The expansion would cost the Treasury nearly $66 billion over 10 years.'Everybody agrees we have to fix our infrastructure; everybody agrees our tax system doesn't work,' said Jeffrey Zients, director of the president's National Economic Council, who spoke of 'strategic alignment' on tax changes and infrastructure as well as 'specific alignments' on the earned income credit.For Republicans in Congress, however, the great strategic cause is balancing the budget. If that trumps other areas of agreement, alignment may not be possible.Under the president's plan, the federal deficit would drop from $583 billion this year - or 3.2 percent of the economy - to $474 billion in 2016, 2.5 percent of the economy. In nominal dollars, the red ink would drift upward from there, to $687 billion by 2025, adding nearly $5.7 trillion to the national debt over a decade.Measured against the gross domestic product, the deficit would remain stable, and the debt would drift downward, from 75 percent of the economy to 73.3 percent in 2025.For Republican leaders, that is not enough. Senator Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming and Representative Tom Price of Georgia, the new chairmen of the congressional budget committees, released a joint statement on Monday declaring, 'A proposal that never balances is not a serious plan for America's fiscal future.' They vowed to produce a budget that does what the White House has explicitly said is unnecessary, namely one that brings spending and taxes into balance.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said Mr. Obama had fallen short of his promise to include 'practical, not partisan' ideas in his budget. He called the plan 'another top-down, backward-looking document that caters to powerful political bosses on the left and never balances - ever.'
