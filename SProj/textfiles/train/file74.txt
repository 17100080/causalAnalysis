WASHINGTON -  With President Obama securing the votes Wednesday needed to assure the Iran nuclear accord will survive congressional challenge, Republicans are considering legislative options to counter the deal, including the possible reimposition of sanctions the agreement is supposed to lift.'While the president may be able to sustain a veto with the tepid, restricted and partisan support of one-third of one house of Congress over Americans' bipartisan opposition,' said Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, 'it will require a bipartisan Congress to strengthen our defenses in the Persian Gulf and to stand up to the inevitable Iranian violations of the agreement that will need to be addressed after he has left office.'Republicans have been thinking through alternatives for months, knowing that Mr. Obama would probably be able to fend off efforts to override his veto of a resolution scuttling the accord. The agreement's implementation seemed assured Wednesday when Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, came out in support, the 34th Democrat to do so, providing Mr. Obama with enough votes to prevent an override of a resolution of disapproval of the deal.For its part, the House will also consider the disapproval resolution next week when Congress returns. Democrats hope to assemble enough votes to sustain a veto in that chamber, as well. A veto override must pass both the House and Senate by a two-thirds vote.Approving new sanctions, even many set to be lifted as part of the accord, is one possible path, said several aides to lawmakers, because it would both send a message to Tehran and the White House and put Democrats in a difficult position.Under the agreement reached with six world powers, Iran would be released from congressionally imposed sanctions related to its nuclear program. Still, Congress could pass new, even tougher terrorism-related sanctions on key Iranian leaders.The White House has repeatedly said the lifting of current sanctions would not lessen Washington's resolve to counter Iranian aggression in the Middle East. But approval of additional sanctions could undermine the legitimacy of the United States with its negotiating partners.Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, alluded to the strategy just before Congress left for its August recess.'One of the first things Congress will do when we finish this debate, I would say give it 60 days, we will pass that extension' on sanctions, Mr. Corker told reporters after a briefing with Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz.But additional options could be in the offing. They include a stand-alone measure to provide more support to Israel, a provision that would approve the use of military force in the region and perhaps a resolution to approve, rather than disapprove, the Iran accord, which could peel away more Democratic support. The House and Senate also are working to reconcile each chamber's defense bill, which could be a vehicle for these or other options.At the same time, many Republicans and Democrats are working to assure that several components of the deal hold up.Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, wrote a letter to Mr. Obama in consultation with several other Democrats expressing concerns about the security of Israel, the role of Europe in maintaining sanctions going forward, assurances that Iran would not be able to spend its new pile of cash on supporting terrorism and monitoring of Iran's nuclear energy.The International Atomic Energy Agency has been tasked to complete a report this year on secret military efforts by Iran to convert its nuclear energy research into weapons work. Under an agreement between the agency and Iran, Iranian scientists are allowed to collect soil samples from a military site called Parchin for analysis by scientists at the agency, an arrangement critics have mocked. But because the details of the agreement have remained secret, supporters of the nuclear accord have had difficulty refuting that criticism.In his reply to Mr. Coons, Mr. Obama said he is confident the energy agency's arrangements to inspect Parchin 'are technically sound, consistent with long-established I.A.E.A. practices, and will provide the information necessary to clarify past and present outstanding issues regarding Iran's nuclear program.'Mr. Coons said he was also pleased with the section of Mr. Obama's letter that said, 'We will maintain powerful sanctions targeting Iran's support for terrorism, its human rights abuses, and destabilizing activities in the region.' Mr. Coons said this addressed 'a legitimate concern I heard over and over is that with tens of billions of dollars in sanctions relief going to Iran, some portion would likely be used to fund terrorism.'The nod to all concerns raised 'played a role in my vote,' Mr. Coons said.Ms. Mikulski's decision came a day after Mr. Coons and Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and several Democrats in the House also announced they would support the deal.With momentum on their side, the White House and Senate Democrats next week hope to find seven more votes to filibuster the Republican resolution of disapproval, something that enrages Republicans, who made ample use of the filibuster when in the minority.Senators Mark S. Kirk, Republican of Illinois, and Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, both opponents of the current Iran accord, introduced legislation this year that would extend the Iran Sanctions Act, which expires at the end of 2016, for another decade.While most lawmakers understand the need to have legal authority to 'snap back' any sanctions that are lifted, Republicans would most likely move to enforce those sanctions, putting Democrats in a bind in an election year by pushing for a vote on legislation to punish Iran for killing Americans and Israelis, and for supporting Hezbollah, leaving the president little choice but to veto because if he signed it, the Iranians would say they are no longer bound by broader agreement.Even if these sanctions are never reimposed, Republicans could use the issue in an effort to divide Democrats in 2016.
